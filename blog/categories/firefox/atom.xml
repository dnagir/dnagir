The big corporations are usually very conservative and in order to change something inside the huge bureaucracy people have to go through many obstacles and justify their decisions.<br />
I wonder how ones could justify that <a href="http://www.sutor.com/c/2010/07/ibm-moving-to-firefox-as-default-browser/" target="_blank">IBM is moving to the Firefox web browser</a>. Whatever the justification is I believe it the positive decision for the word-wide-web and normal people using the web.<br />
Do the corporations still have a passion and not only the financial benefits? Maybe both: complementing each other? That would be an idealistic world.</div>

I often use Firefox beside my IE (currently version 6 and 7) during my development.
Very often I need to test some page in both IE and Firefox. So I need to keep both browsers open together. But after I found very nice add-on for Firefox this is not the case anymore.
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1419/">Here</a> it is.
This allows to switch browser at runtime when Firefox is open.
Woulld be good to have something like for IE too.
Or maybe it already exists?</div>
