I've just read an <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/10/26/Must-resist.-decoding.aspx">article</a>.
Ayende links to this <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/10/25/thoughts-for-a-thursday/">message</a> which is just a text represented in binary.
Like in a Matrix :)...

If you want to decode it - you'll find the message interesting... A bit depressing, but I like to think about such kind of things.

<span style="font-size: 55%;">If you are too lazy to decode it... <a href="http://dnagir.googlepages.com/RobConery-decoded.txt" target="_blank">Here it is.</a>
</span>

<span style="font-size: 55%;">And <a href="http://dnagir.googlepages.com/Ayende-decoded.txt" target="_blank">here</a> is what Ayende says about it :)

Today I was looking for a compact and fast CSV reader and found one.
It satisfies all my requirements.

But when I was reading comments some guy had a problem and didn't know what to do with it.
Ready? He wrote following:
<span style="color: #660000; font-family: verdana; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I downloaded the .NET 2.0 demo version, and it won't run because it is looking for a </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-weight: bold;">namespace called NUnit</span>.</span>

The author is a really good guy - he politely answered to add reference to NUnit or remove NUnit project from solution.

I was laughing some minutes of this. Are there people (developers) in the world who don't know about xUnit?

Or maybe he is just not a developer... Or maybe he's just having fun asking it...
There can be some excuses for him. But anyway it was very funny for me to see such kind of a question.</div>
