It turns out there are a lot IT holidays out there. So we can make celebration pretty often :)<br />
Here is the list:<br />
<ul>
<li><b>International Day without Internet (last Sunday of January)</b>. It is intended to have one day with no computer, internet. Just be offline and go and visit your relatives, friends; go to park etc.</li>
<li><b>Day of secure Internet (1st Tuesday of February)</b>. The aim is to inform users about security issues in world wide web.</li>
<li><b>Computer geek day (February 14)</b>. The day of people in love with computers… If seriously, it is the day when (14 February, 1946) the first electronic digital computer (ENIAC) was launched which actually worked, and even performed calculations (ballistic tables of the U.S. Army). And BTW this is <b>my birthday</b>… What a coincident :)</li>
<li><b>Overclocker day (28 February or 29th on the overclocked year)</b>. This seems to be born in Russia in 2004.&nbsp; Not much to add to this. Every gamer knows what overclkocking is.</li>
<li><b>IT-Professional day (28 February)</b>. Invention of network cable. Just another reason to have couple of drinks with colleagues.</li>
<li><b>Day of freedom of speech in Internet (12 March)</b>. Initiated by <a href="http://unesco.org/" target="_blank">UNESCO</a> as part of “Reporters without Borders” program on 12 March 2008. The aim is to support Internet descendants who might be in prison. Organisers ask to to give your NO to the censure in the Internet.</li>
<li><b>Shutdown Day (24 March)</b>. For the first time this holiday was celebrated March 24, 2007. That day a call came to shut down as many computers as possible arround the world. The purpose of is to find out how many people can survive a day without a computer. The authors of this idea are programmers who live in Montreal (Canada), Denis Bystrov (born in Belarus) and Ashutosh Rajekar (born in India).</li>
<li><b>RuNet Birthday (7 April)</b>. On the 7th of April 1994&nbsp; The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) had registered the domain <b>.ru</b> for Russia.</li>
<li><b>Cryptographic service day (5 May)</b>. The service was organised in Russia in 1921 to empower security of communications within Russia and outside of it.</li>
<li><b>International Day of Information Society (IT-Day, 17 May)</b>. UN recognises it as a day of all IT geeks (software devs, admins, Internet providers, web-designers etc) since 2006. The same day, 17 May, but 1865 International Telegraph Union was established in France.</li>
<li><b>Sys Admin day (last Friday of July)</b>. This idea came to mind of sys-admin from Chicago (Ted Kekatos). First celebrated on 28 July 2000. BTW, Pope of Rome, the same year, officially called St. Issidor (clarification?) the governor of all computer and internet users.</li>
<li><b>Tester’s day (9 September)</b>. This day 1945 in Harvard university a butterfly was found in Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator during the testing. It got the start for this day.</li>
<li><b>Developer’s day (256th days of a year)</b>. Professional day of a developer celebrated on the symbolic, 256th day of the year. The idea came from Russian developer Valentin Balt. This day became official in Russia only since 2009, but was celebrated since 2002.</li>
<li><b>Smiley birthday (19 September).</b> On 19 September 1982 professor from Scott E. Fahlman from Carnegie Mellon University first time suggested to use three symbols <b>:-)</b> to be interpreted as a smiling face. Nowadays these symbols are used everywhere.</li>
<li><b>International Day Of Internet (30 September)</b>. This holiday was offered to become official several times at different times. However, none of the suggested dates did not become a tradition. As for Russia, at the informal level, the Day of the Internet is September 30. Such an initiative came from the Moscow company, "IT Infoart Stars".</li>
<li><b>International Day of Information (26 November)</b>. Initiated my International Academy of Infromatisation. Any person dealing with information in any kind can celebrate this day.</li>
<li><b>International day of information protection (30 November)</b>. This holiday is celebrated from November 30, 1988 at the initiative of the American Association of computer equipment. The purpose is to remind everyone of the need to protect computer information, drawing attention of producers and users of hardware and software security problems. It was a in 1988, was recorded first mass epidemic of computer virus. It was a worm, named in honor of its author Morris.</li>
<li><b>Birthday of computer science in Russia (4 December)</b>. In August 1948, reporter, member of AN USSR Isaac Brook together with engineer Bashir Rameevym presented the project of automatic computing machines. A Dec. 4, 1948 State Committee of the Council of Ministers introduced the advanced technology and registered this invention under the number 10475, entitled "Digital electronic calculating machine”. </li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
Last weekend I’ve got the <a href="http://www.prototypegame.com/" target="_blank">Prototype Game</a>. I like it a lot and the game play is very enjoying. But all that came did not come such simple. After I installed the game and tried it on me Athlon XP 64 6000+ and GeForce 6500 512 MB system I had probably about 5 FPS in the game. The system still satisfies minimum requirements.<br />
I though that my systems is already old for the game, so I upgrades CPU and graphic card to x4 Phenom 9650 and Radeon 4850 1GB graphic card. I expected at least <i>some</i> improvement in the game experience, to play the game at least a bit smoother… But the hardware upgrade did not change anything (at least visually I could not mention the difference).<br />
And this is at 640x480 resolution with everything set to minimum (though there are no many options in the game itself).<br />
I went to their forum and found that many people have performance issues with this game. And the suggestion to fix it is to <b>disable all HID devices (USB devices) except ones in use (mouse/keyboard)</b>.<br />
It is weird but it worked for me. Now I can play the game pretty smoothly at its max.<br />
I probably did not need to upgrade at all. But I like the new system :). I hardly ever need the QUAD processor at home except for gaming. The rating on my Vista is 5.9 which is neither best ever score nor worst. I have 5.9 on each item in the system. On the prev system lowest score was 5.4: HDD; 5.6 - Memory. After upgrading CPU and graphic card I got 5.9 on every item. So far so good. Waiting for the next hungry game.<br />
And one more time, I really enjoy the game… Even knowing that I don’t like so much killing and stuff like that.</div>

I has just been asked that this question. And I haven't really known the answer. One supposition that made me smile "<i>Is it because of it is very slow?</i>"<a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank"><img align="right" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Tortoisesvn_logo_hor468x64.PNG" /></a><br />
Ok, I suspected the <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/node/61" target="_blank">answer is</a>...<br />
<blockquote>
<i>The name of the program was fixed when we started, because the CVS counterpart is called </i><a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/"><i>TortoiseCVS</i></a><i>.</i></blockquote>
&nbsp; <br />
But I don't really see where <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/">TortoiseCVS</a> came from? As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TortoiseCVS" target="_blank">Wiki says</a>:<a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/" target="_blank"><img align="right" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/61/TortoiseCVS-Logo.jpeg" /></a><br />
<blockquote>
<i>The name is a pun on the word </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29"><i>shell</i></a></blockquote>
Which doesn't make a lot of sense for me. So what's the truth?</div>

<p>Computers are very powerful these days. But it's not still enough to solve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_problem" target="_blank">mathematical problems</a>. One way to leverage the calculating power is distributing it among users all around the world.</p>  <p>People can just run small applications to help scientific world. Not a problem at all. The software will just do its stuff silently.</p>  <p>Also people can help science manually. Who is going to spend time for that? Will you do it? Well, maybe. But there is very good solution to this problem: <strong>let people contribute even not letting them know about it</strong>.</p>  <p>This is exactly what <a href="http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html" target="_blank">reCAPTCHA</a> is doing. It digitises old books using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition" target="_blank">OCR</a>. But prompts users to decipher unrecognised words.</p>  <p><strong>What does user see?</strong></p>  <p>Users generally see prompt to enter two words to prove they are not robots, but humans. Nothing special. Nothing at all.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/dnagir/SBpq3RS_uAI/AAAAAAAAC3E/rtTOhIwKdNU/s1600-h/reCAPTCHA-Sample%5B3%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="127" alt="reCAPTCHA Sample" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/dnagir/SBpq4hS_uBI/AAAAAAAAC3M/Nshg9b367lc/reCAPTCHA-Sample_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="317" border="0" /></a></p>  <p><strong>What is behind the scene?</strong></p>  <p>This is the most interesting thing. reCAPTCHA has its own <a href="http://recaptcha.net/apidocs/captcha/client.html" target="_blank">API</a> (ASP.NET Control is also <a href="http://recaptcha.net/plugins/aspnet/" target="_blank">available</a>), so it is easy to integrate it with any server.</p>  <p>And here's how it works:</p>  <ol>   <li>User enters TWO words.</li>    <li>One of the words is <em>known</em> for reCAPTCHA, another - isn't (<em>unknown)</em>.</li>    <li>If the <em>known</em> word is correct, reCAPTCHA assumes that user entered <em>unknown</em> word correctly. It also tells user about correct answer.</li>    <li>To be more confident that <em>unknown</em> word is deciphered correctly it is shown on other images.</li> </ol>  <p>As simple as that.</p>  <p>We also can try to enter <strong>only</strong> one word correctly and after several times we will pass the CAPTCHA! It doesn't look good for the user, but it still does the job. You have to be a human to recognise at least one word. And wrong word should not abuse the system because of it will be sent to many people and it is so unlikely they all will provide the same and wrong word.</p>  <p>There's one note about it. If you want to distribute your (web) application you will push your clients to obtain public key for their domain in order to use the reCAPTCHA.</p>  </div>
