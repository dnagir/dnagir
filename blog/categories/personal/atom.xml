I have watched the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWHkcCP3tA">RailsConf 2010 by Gary Vaynerchuk</a> and I believe that was <b>one of the best presentations I have seen</b> in a very long while.<br />
<br />
Gary is just outstanding and I highly recommend you to watch this video it (but be prepared - there is a log of swearing, which I actually like).<br />
<br />
There is nothing about Ruby (On Rails), .NET, Java or any other technology.<br />
This is just a talk about what you <b>should care about</b> as a business owner, this is about <b>appreciation of the digital era</b> we are living in. Also it is about <b>caring</b> about people, and <b>cutting bullshit</b>.<br />
<br />
Sit, make yourself comfortable and DO WATCH it:<br />

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
It turns out there are a lot IT holidays out there. So we can make celebration pretty often :)<br />
Here is the list:<br />
<ul>
<li><b>International Day without Internet (last Sunday of January)</b>. It is intended to have one day with no computer, internet. Just be offline and go and visit your relatives, friends; go to park etc.</li>
<li><b>Day of secure Internet (1st Tuesday of February)</b>. The aim is to inform users about security issues in world wide web.</li>
<li><b>Computer geek day (February 14)</b>. The day of people in love with computers… If seriously, it is the day when (14 February, 1946) the first electronic digital computer (ENIAC) was launched which actually worked, and even performed calculations (ballistic tables of the U.S. Army). And BTW this is <b>my birthday</b>… What a coincident :)</li>
<li><b>Overclocker day (28 February or 29th on the overclocked year)</b>. This seems to be born in Russia in 2004.&nbsp; Not much to add to this. Every gamer knows what overclkocking is.</li>
<li><b>IT-Professional day (28 February)</b>. Invention of network cable. Just another reason to have couple of drinks with colleagues.</li>
<li><b>Day of freedom of speech in Internet (12 March)</b>. Initiated by <a href="http://unesco.org/" target="_blank">UNESCO</a> as part of “Reporters without Borders” program on 12 March 2008. The aim is to support Internet descendants who might be in prison. Organisers ask to to give your NO to the censure in the Internet.</li>
<li><b>Shutdown Day (24 March)</b>. For the first time this holiday was celebrated March 24, 2007. That day a call came to shut down as many computers as possible arround the world. The purpose of is to find out how many people can survive a day without a computer. The authors of this idea are programmers who live in Montreal (Canada), Denis Bystrov (born in Belarus) and Ashutosh Rajekar (born in India).</li>
<li><b>RuNet Birthday (7 April)</b>. On the 7th of April 1994&nbsp; The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) had registered the domain <b>.ru</b> for Russia.</li>
<li><b>Cryptographic service day (5 May)</b>. The service was organised in Russia in 1921 to empower security of communications within Russia and outside of it.</li>
<li><b>International Day of Information Society (IT-Day, 17 May)</b>. UN recognises it as a day of all IT geeks (software devs, admins, Internet providers, web-designers etc) since 2006. The same day, 17 May, but 1865 International Telegraph Union was established in France.</li>
<li><b>Sys Admin day (last Friday of July)</b>. This idea came to mind of sys-admin from Chicago (Ted Kekatos). First celebrated on 28 July 2000. BTW, Pope of Rome, the same year, officially called St. Issidor (clarification?) the governor of all computer and internet users.</li>
<li><b>Tester’s day (9 September)</b>. This day 1945 in Harvard university a butterfly was found in Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator during the testing. It got the start for this day.</li>
<li><b>Developer’s day (256th days of a year)</b>. Professional day of a developer celebrated on the symbolic, 256th day of the year. The idea came from Russian developer Valentin Balt. This day became official in Russia only since 2009, but was celebrated since 2002.</li>
<li><b>Smiley birthday (19 September).</b> On 19 September 1982 professor from Scott E. Fahlman from Carnegie Mellon University first time suggested to use three symbols <b>:-)</b> to be interpreted as a smiling face. Nowadays these symbols are used everywhere.</li>
<li><b>International Day Of Internet (30 September)</b>. This holiday was offered to become official several times at different times. However, none of the suggested dates did not become a tradition. As for Russia, at the informal level, the Day of the Internet is September 30. Such an initiative came from the Moscow company, "IT Infoart Stars".</li>
<li><b>International Day of Information (26 November)</b>. Initiated my International Academy of Infromatisation. Any person dealing with information in any kind can celebrate this day.</li>
<li><b>International day of information protection (30 November)</b>. This holiday is celebrated from November 30, 1988 at the initiative of the American Association of computer equipment. The purpose is to remind everyone of the need to protect computer information, drawing attention of producers and users of hardware and software security problems. It was a in 1988, was recorded first mass epidemic of computer virus. It was a worm, named in honor of its author Morris.</li>
<li><b>Birthday of computer science in Russia (4 December)</b>. In August 1948, reporter, member of AN USSR Isaac Brook together with engineer Bashir Rameevym presented the project of automatic computing machines. A Dec. 4, 1948 State Committee of the Council of Ministers introduced the advanced technology and registered this invention under the number 10475, entitled "Digital electronic calculating machine”. </li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
I got a friendly email from a guy (I don’t know him) who was trying to promote his web site. It looked pretty new and was about sharing the developer resources.<br />
He asked me to contribute. There are plenty of similar sites.<br />
Next day I saw the guys is willing to chat with me in Gmail.<br />
I wanted to know where he found me from and then see if i can help him. Yes I am often concerned where they get the email from. In fact I had number of similar situation and everybody was happy at the end of the day (they got their promotions in one or the other way, I just got “thanks” or something more material).<br />

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
&nbsp;<img align="left" src="http://img1.liveinternet.ru/images/attach/b/2/24/497/24497771_9maya.jpg" style="display: inline; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" /> Year <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1945#May" target="_blank">1945, May 9</a> is a Victory Day that is celebrated in countries of former USSR (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-E_Day" target="_blank">VE Day</a> in Europe). This is a Victory Day, a holiday with tears in the eyes. So many people killed&nbsp; and we do remember those soldiers, those brave people who stood up till death for their homes, their country and their believes. They were not politicians, they were not thinking about anything except protecting their homes. That the holly truth, in all of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states" target="_blank">post-soviet</a> countries.<br />
Every country has a day similar to this. In Australia, we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZAC_Day" target="_blank">ANZAC day</a>.<br />
Only Russian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties" target="_blank">casualties</a> are estimated to be up to 27 <b>million </b>people; whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" target="_blank">British Commonwealth</a> – 12 <b>million</b>.<br />
Only these 2 numbers scare to death. For example: population of Australia is ~ 20 million, North Korea – 23, Belgium – 10, Germany – 82.   <br />We can say,&nbsp; in total, – countries and maybe even continents were eliminated.<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=World+will+not+survive+WW3" target="_blank">World will not survive WW3</a>. Learn the lessons of history. Whatever your religion and believe is…<br />
<br />
God bless you! No more wars!<img align="right" src="http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/pic/152/GN0120%7ENo-War-Posters.jpg" style="display: inline; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px;" /><br />
<br />
Let The God give, veterans, many happy years!   <br />We were born, when everything was in the past,    <br />Our Victory is older than dozens years,    <br />But how the past is close to us.    <br />Let The God give, veterans, many happy years!    <br />And every year, the soul in pain and tears,    <br />Remembering the words of those years.    <br />The spirit of celebration in the air hovers,    <br />A shroud of a sadness still lives in our eyes.    <br />Thank you, for no war we live in,    <br />For not hearing the noise of terrible years,    <br />For giving you life away for us to live!    <br />Let The God, veterans, give you many happy years!    <br />Let everyone remembers the feat of your life,    <br />Let the people remember your name.    <br />And let wars of the world fall silent     <br />In the day when the cherry blooms.    <br />Yes - this is the holiday of your gray hairs,    <br />You have a lot of ills.    <br />We bow low, to the ground,    <br />Let The God give, veterans, many happy years!<br />
<br />
I’ve got congratulation from my friend's mother and those who can understand please do a minute of silence:<br />
<b>Успешно Гитлер начал свой блиц-план:<img align="right" src="http://oneyearbibleimages.com/god_bless_you.jpg" style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" />      <br />Ползла по миру, множась, злая сила      <br />За счёт ресурсов покорённых стран…      <br />Ужасно это всё, но это было!</b><br />
<br /><b>Мечтая превратить весь мир в рабов,     <br />Фашисты из людей варили мыло,      <br />Топили ими печи вместо дров…      <br />Ужасно это всё, но это было!</b><br />
<br /><b>Добрался Гитлер вскоре и до нас:     <br />Росли повсюду братские могилы –       <br />Удел (по наци) не арийских рас…      <br />Ужасно это всё, но это было!</b><br />
<br /><b>Солдат наш грудью встретил смерти шквал.     <br />Он каждой пяди не сдавал без боя:      <br />От жажды умирая, Брест держал       <br />И амбразуру закрывал собою.</b><br />
<br /><b>Вгрызаясь в землю, сдерживал врага –     <br />Шла от напряга кровь и рвались жилы.      <br />Врага была уж над Москвой нога …      <br />Ужасно это всё, но это было! </b><br />
<br /><b>Ни метр без боя им земли не сдан:     <br />В окопе мёрз и жил в простой землянке       <br />Он шёл, истратив пули, на таран      <br />И, истекая кровью, полз на танки.</b><br />
<br /><b>Израненный, был смерти на краю     <br />И под бинтами вши кусали раны,      <br />Но он, как вшу, врага прижал к ногтю –      <br />Зря предвкушал победу враг так рано!</b><br />
<br /><b>Спасибо и поклон тебе, солдат,     <br />За то, что ты перетерпел всё это,      <br />За то, что зла сильнее во сто крат,      <br />За эту долгожданную победу!</b><br />
<br /><b>Гордится, что сыны её сильны     <br />И ныне благодарная Россия:      <br />Не вынес бы солдат другой страны      <br />Лишения и тяготы такие!</b></div>

С Днем Победы! <br /><br />Мы в крыму в это время были. <br />Помнят люди, отлично помнят, причем все- и с сибири там были товарищи, и с разных концов украины, и местные. Туристы, по крайней мере, помнят. <br /><br />И песни ЭТИ помнят. И поют. И это хорошо.</div>

I haven’t been blogging for a while and even thought about giving it up. Sometimes I just didn't have time.<br />
But i want to recover a bit and write at least summary of thing I would like to write about.<br />
<br />
For now I’ll just post the summary of the most interesting/exciting thing that happened during last months. So here we go:<br />
<ul>
<li>Official ASP.NET MVC Release. It still has a lot of thing to improve, but I enjoy it. I mean it. I really do. And even wrote my own library with different extensions. Also MvcContrib’s <a href="http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk/2009/02/08/rewriting-the-mvccontrib-grid/" target="_blank">Grid</a> is pretty exciting now (not very good with paging, filtering, sorting but still).</li>
<li><a href="http://extjs.com/blog/2009/04/04/ext-core-30-beta-released/" target="_blank">Recently release ExtJs Core</a>. This is MIT licensed, cut version of ExtJS (whiGPL-licensed). It supports the DOM manipulations, Ajax, effects etc. Well. everything that any other JavaScript library does. Why I put this here? We need to remember that ExtJS used to <b>L</b>GPL licensed which allowed to deploy it. A lot of <a href="http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=33096" target="_blank">issues were raised</a> when it became GPL licensed. So they release part of it with very permissive MIT license. Good for those to transfer from old LGPL ExtJS to this one, even if it’s cut down. (I think I would still prefer jQuery instead, they did change license to more strict once, so they can completely make it commercial).</li>
<li>A lot of talks around <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=Google+becomes+evil" target="_blank">Google becomes evil</a> (yep, the link is Google search:)).</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.codeville.net/2009/03/27/first-steps-with-lightweight-test-automation-framework/" target="_blank">Lightweight Test Automation Framework</a>. Wanted to play with it. No time found.</li>
<li>IE8 has been released. Get ready to go and fix all the things on all websites. I don’t like when a new major version of any browser is released :)</li>
<li>Real-life code sample: <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2009/03/19/how-not-to-write-a-logger.aspx" target="_blank">How NOT to write a logger</a> (have fun).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FreeASPNETMVCEBookNerdDinnercomWalkthrough.aspx" target="_blank">Free ASP.NET MVC Book</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.capableobjects.com/apps/InstantKB13/KnowledgebaseArticle50020.aspx" target="_blank">ECO5</a> gets released soon. It seems there’s still no ability to extend operations executed on the Database Server. Linq2Eco is far from supporting everything that Linq2Sql does. All other is great.</li>
<li>Reminder. ding, ding: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001210.html" target="_blank">Most Dangerous Programming mistakes</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.codeville.net/2009/01/10/xval-a-validation-framework-for-aspnet-mvc/" target="_blank">xVal</a> – validation framework for MVC. Woth looking at.</li>
<li><a href="http://mrpmorris.blogspot.com/2009/04/my-first-aop_08.html" target="_blank">AOP</a> in Delphi – it’s better than just PostSharp because you can use the Aspects (PostSharp just postcompiles it)</li>
<li>Probably something else…</li>
</ul>
I have been working on a project with Ms Access fron-end and Sql Server back-end. I’ll write another story about it. Can tell in a short that I had a lot of fun (mostly hysterical). Sometimes I hated it, sometimes I loved. Good old client-server DOESN’T suck.<br />
<br />
Now leaving office and going for holidays!<br />
<br />
<b>Happy Easter!</b></div>
