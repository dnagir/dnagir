The big corporations are usually very conservative and in order to change something inside the huge bureaucracy people have to go through many obstacles and justify their decisions.<br />
I wonder how ones could justify that <a href="http://www.sutor.com/c/2010/07/ibm-moving-to-firefox-as-default-browser/" target="_blank">IBM is moving to the Firefox web browser</a>. Whatever the justification is I believe it the positive decision for the word-wide-web and normal people using the web.<br />
Do the corporations still have a passion and not only the financial benefits? Maybe both: complementing each other? That would be an idealistic world.</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
It turns out there are a lot IT holidays out there. So we can make celebration pretty often :)<br />
Here is the list:<br />
<ul>
<li><b>International Day without Internet (last Sunday of January)</b>. It is intended to have one day with no computer, internet. Just be offline and go and visit your relatives, friends; go to park etc.</li>
<li><b>Day of secure Internet (1st Tuesday of February)</b>. The aim is to inform users about security issues in world wide web.</li>
<li><b>Computer geek day (February 14)</b>. The day of people in love with computers… If seriously, it is the day when (14 February, 1946) the first electronic digital computer (ENIAC) was launched which actually worked, and even performed calculations (ballistic tables of the U.S. Army). And BTW this is <b>my birthday</b>… What a coincident :)</li>
<li><b>Overclocker day (28 February or 29th on the overclocked year)</b>. This seems to be born in Russia in 2004.&nbsp; Not much to add to this. Every gamer knows what overclkocking is.</li>
<li><b>IT-Professional day (28 February)</b>. Invention of network cable. Just another reason to have couple of drinks with colleagues.</li>
<li><b>Day of freedom of speech in Internet (12 March)</b>. Initiated by <a href="http://unesco.org/" target="_blank">UNESCO</a> as part of “Reporters without Borders” program on 12 March 2008. The aim is to support Internet descendants who might be in prison. Organisers ask to to give your NO to the censure in the Internet.</li>
<li><b>Shutdown Day (24 March)</b>. For the first time this holiday was celebrated March 24, 2007. That day a call came to shut down as many computers as possible arround the world. The purpose of is to find out how many people can survive a day without a computer. The authors of this idea are programmers who live in Montreal (Canada), Denis Bystrov (born in Belarus) and Ashutosh Rajekar (born in India).</li>
<li><b>RuNet Birthday (7 April)</b>. On the 7th of April 1994&nbsp; The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) had registered the domain <b>.ru</b> for Russia.</li>
<li><b>Cryptographic service day (5 May)</b>. The service was organised in Russia in 1921 to empower security of communications within Russia and outside of it.</li>
<li><b>International Day of Information Society (IT-Day, 17 May)</b>. UN recognises it as a day of all IT geeks (software devs, admins, Internet providers, web-designers etc) since 2006. The same day, 17 May, but 1865 International Telegraph Union was established in France.</li>
<li><b>Sys Admin day (last Friday of July)</b>. This idea came to mind of sys-admin from Chicago (Ted Kekatos). First celebrated on 28 July 2000. BTW, Pope of Rome, the same year, officially called St. Issidor (clarification?) the governor of all computer and internet users.</li>
<li><b>Tester’s day (9 September)</b>. This day 1945 in Harvard university a butterfly was found in Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator during the testing. It got the start for this day.</li>
<li><b>Developer’s day (256th days of a year)</b>. Professional day of a developer celebrated on the symbolic, 256th day of the year. The idea came from Russian developer Valentin Balt. This day became official in Russia only since 2009, but was celebrated since 2002.</li>
<li><b>Smiley birthday (19 September).</b> On 19 September 1982 professor from Scott E. Fahlman from Carnegie Mellon University first time suggested to use three symbols <b>:-)</b> to be interpreted as a smiling face. Nowadays these symbols are used everywhere.</li>
<li><b>International Day Of Internet (30 September)</b>. This holiday was offered to become official several times at different times. However, none of the suggested dates did not become a tradition. As for Russia, at the informal level, the Day of the Internet is September 30. Such an initiative came from the Moscow company, "IT Infoart Stars".</li>
<li><b>International Day of Information (26 November)</b>. Initiated my International Academy of Infromatisation. Any person dealing with information in any kind can celebrate this day.</li>
<li><b>International day of information protection (30 November)</b>. This holiday is celebrated from November 30, 1988 at the initiative of the American Association of computer equipment. The purpose is to remind everyone of the need to protect computer information, drawing attention of producers and users of hardware and software security problems. It was a in 1988, was recorded first mass epidemic of computer virus. It was a worm, named in honor of its author Morris.</li>
<li><b>Birthday of computer science in Russia (4 December)</b>. In August 1948, reporter, member of AN USSR Isaac Brook together with engineer Bashir Rameevym presented the project of automatic computing machines. A Dec. 4, 1948 State Committee of the Council of Ministers introduced the advanced technology and registered this invention under the number 10475, entitled "Digital electronic calculating machine”. </li>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Fake wild-card mapping in Graffiti CMS]]></title>
    <link href="http://ApproachE.com/blog/fake-wild-card-mapping-in-graffiti-cms/"/>
    <updated>2009-09-25T10:39:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://ApproachE.com/blog/fake-wild-card-mapping-in-graffiti-cms</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
I have just installed <a href="http://graffiticms.com/" target="_blank">Graffiti CMS</a> to play with it. <br />
After the installation I created a test post and only after that noticed the URL:   <br /><span style="font-family: Courier New;">http://localhost/Graffiti/<b>first-post</b></span><br />
Notice there is not any extension and the URL looks very clear. But HOW? I did not do neither of the following:<br />
<ol>
<li>Added wild-card mapping;</li>
<li>Configured Web.config with IIS 7 as I have IIS 6;</li>
<li>Run any script or something.</li>
</ol>
Then I looked at the folder of Graffiti CMS and found it has the folder named “first-post” in the root which contains only one file - Default.aspx.<br />
The Default.aspx is auto-generated and just has some settings. The content is stored in the database.<br />
Do you see now how this wildcard-mapping works?<br />
It just allows IIS to handle friendly-urls by creating a real resource. But the actual URL that gets processed on the server is:   <br /><span style="font-family: Courier New;">http://localhost/Graffiti/<b>first-post/Default.aspx</b></span><br />
That does make assumption that IIS has Default Document with name “Default.aspx”. Removing it will kill the whole idea of such friendly-urls.<br />
The idea is dead simple and indeed a good one.<br />
I am not sure weather I like it or not. One thing I definitely don’t like so far is the fact that the folder will get polluted with all those folders and files.</div>

    <link href="http://ApproachE.com/blog/9999-available-aspnet-and-sql-server/"/>
    <updated>2008-12-16T13:46:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://ApproachE.com/blog/9999-available-aspnet-and-sql-server</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
I'll summarise a very nice <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/ProdArch.aspx">article</a> here:<br />
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/ProdArch/ProdArch.png" target="_blank" title="Open in a new window"><img align="right" alt="Architecture" height="417" src="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/ProdArch/ProdArch.png" width="300" /></a>   <br />
<ul>
<li>Always use public <b>firewall </b>and:       <br />
<ul>
<li>only expose 80, 443 ports; </li>
<li>do not open FTP; </li>
<li>do not open file sharing ports; </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use <b>two Ethernet ports</b>: one for to serve external requests, one for local access. </li>
<li>"Keep your <b>load balancer dead simple</b> – use basic round robin". </li>
<li>Each router and firewall has a <b>standby </b>one. </li>
<li>Get moderately powerful Web servers with <b>enough storage</b>. </li>
<li>Run <b>64bit </b>version of Windows. </li>
<li>The whole internal network is fully <b>1Gbit </b>(network cables, routers/switches, NICs etc). </li>
<li><b>Only use VPN</b> to access your server. </li>
<li>Database servers must be the most powerful (<b>RAID 10 </b>Disks, Memory, CPU). </li>
<li>Store Database files on a separate <b>physical</b> disk. </li>
<li>Always <b>perform backup and log shipping</b> to different physical disks, preferably on RAID 1. </li>
<li>Use <b>Windows Clustering </b>for high availability with Storage Area Network. </li>
<li>RAM,<b> lots of RAM</b> for Database servers (2 GB + 60% of MDF size). </li>
<li>Get <b>Dual Path Fiber</b> Channel connection to SAN from your servers. </li>
<li>Have a <b>separate server for moving IIS logs</b> from webserver. </li>
<li>Have a large<b> detachable external storage</b> like External USB drives. </li>
<li>Use<b> fast SCSI RAID 1</b> disks. </li>
<li>Use <b>separate NIC</b> on all servers that is connected to a separate private network via separate switch <b>for bulk operations</b>. </li>
</ul>
Please keep in mind these suggestions are for really heavy duty web applications.</div>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Gladinet - Remote Drive for Google Docs, Picasa, Skydrive]]></title>
    <link href="http://ApproachE.com/blog/remote-drive-for-google-docs-picasa/"/>
    <updated>2008-12-03T09:30:00+11:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<h2>In the sky</h2>  <p><a href="http://www.gladinet.com">Gladinet</a> allows to use in the sky storage the same way as your local hard drive. <a href="http://www.gladinet.com">Check this out</a>.</p>  <p>It also features with:</p>  <ul>   <li>Remote Access To Multiple PCs </li>    <li>On Demand Sharing With Friends </li>    <li>Remote Desktop Access </li>    <li>Service Redirection </li>    <li>Secure Access </li>    <li>Instantly Available </li>    <li>On Demand Share </li>    <li>Native OS Support </li>    <li>Secure Access </li>    <li>Aggregates All My Favorites </li>    <li>Access From Web Browser </li>    <li>Gladinet Web Directory </li> </ul>  <p>Looks impressive and for now it's free. not sure what will happen after the Preview period. Here is the snippet from license:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>There are no fees for the Product offered to You <strong>during the Preview period</strong>. Gladinet reserves the right to institute new charges for access to or use of the Product at any time upon not less than thirty (30) days' notice to You.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Also what about privacy? They say:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then <strong>we will ask for your consent</strong> prior to such use.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Ok. I believe that and that's fine with me. And also they seem to be very reasonable in their terms and privacy. For example:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy <strong>without your explicit consent</strong>, and we expect most such changes will be minor.</p> </blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>So looks very good and promising. But I expect it will become a paid service. If the price will be reasonable I'd probably pay for that.</p>  <p></p>  <hr />  <p></p>  <h2>First Experience</h2>  <p>After installation it could start because of port 80 is busy (IIS). Then it give helpful suggestion how to solve the issue: We have to change the port in IIS <strong>or</strong> explicitly set IP address to listen to. I choose 2nd option of course. But we also need to disable Socket Pooling.</p>  <p>After I have followed detailed instructions everything started to work.</p>  <p>Next observation is that Standalone version doesn't require a login, standard does. So I wanted to register there but it seems the account at Forum and the application is not the same (I need to have 2 accounts). But I couldn't just register - I have to wait for the invitation. Unlucky.</p>  <p>Let's get back to the standalone version.</p>  </div>

I'm not sure about this. For me it seem that "ask for your consent" should sound like "notify you".<BR/>But anyway we'll (at least) be notified and we will know what they are going to do. So at least we can perform appropriate actions.</div>

"ask for your consent" is not the same as "obtain your consent".<BR/><BR/>Legally they only have to ask before continuing, and don't need to consider your reply :-)</div>
