The big corporations are usually very conservative and in order to change something inside the huge bureaucracy people have to go through many obstacles and justify their decisions.<br />
I wonder how ones could justify that <a href="http://www.sutor.com/c/2010/07/ibm-moving-to-firefox-as-default-browser/" target="_blank">IBM is moving to the Firefox web browser</a>. Whatever the justification is I believe it the positive decision for the word-wide-web and normal people using the web.<br />
Do the corporations still have a passion and not only the financial benefits? Maybe both: complementing each other? That would be an idealistic world.</div>

If you are not living under the rock, you must know a lot of buzzing around HTML5 and CSS3.<br />
And if you want to keep up with technologies so that you won’t become a grand daddy saying “I work with HTML1 and no CSS which works on all browsers”, then you DO HAVE to learn HTML5.<br />
And there is one more opportunity for that, a great book from the great publisher (PragProg):<br />
<a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/bhh5/html5-and-css3" target="_blank">HTML5 and CSS3: Develop with Tomorrow&#8217;s Standards Today</a><br />
Looking at the excerpts, I do like it for now and will get it as soon as I will have finished some of my other readings.</div>

A while ago I wrote about <a href="http://blog.approache.com/2010/02/agile-manifesto-reminder.html">agile manifesto</a> everybody should keep in mind (when they claim to be agily-ish). Now I want to quote the principle of the Agile. This is another reminder for my after reading the great book - <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/news/the-agile-samurai">The Agile Samurai</a>. Highly recommend it.<br />
So here <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">they are</a>:<br />
<ol>
<li>Our highest priority is to <b>satisfy the customer       </b>through <b>early and continuous delivery</b>      <br />of valuable software.</li>
<li><b>Welcome changing requirements</b>, even late in      <br />development. Agile processes harness change for      <br />the customer&#8217;s competitive advantage.</li>
<li><b>Deliver working software frequently</b>, from a      <br />couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a      <br />preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
<li>Business people and developers must <b>work       <br />together </b>daily throughout the project.</li>
<li>Build projects around <b>motivated individuals</b>.      <br />Give them the environment and support they need,      <br />and <b>trust them </b>to get the job done.</li>
<li>The most efficient and effective method of     <br />conveying information to and within a development      <br />team is <b>face-to-face conversation</b>.</li>
<li><b>Working software</b> is the primary <b>measure of progress</b>.</li>
<li>Agile processes promote <b>sustainable development</b>.      <br />The sponsors, developers, and users should be able      <br />to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
<li><b>Continuous</b> attention to <b>technical excellence</b>      <br />and good design enhances agility.</li>
<li><b>Simplicity</b> - the art of maximizing the amount      <br />of work not done - is essential.</li>
<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs     <br />emerge from <b>self-organizing teams</b>.</li>
<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how     <br />to <b>become more effective</b>, then tunes and adjusts      <br />its behavior accordingly.</li>
</ol></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>I am being reading the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/architecting-tekpub">Architecting TekPub - Moving from ASP.NET MVC to Ruby on Rail</a>. There are number of interesting things in there that I would like to quote.</p>  <p>First most notable is COST. ASP.NET MVC and thus Microsoft stack is pretty expensive and you cannot always justify the cost:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><strong>RB:</strong> If the platform [ASP.NET MVC] was holding up fine, what prompted the change of architecture?</em></p>    <p><strong>RC: </strong>Money. We were enrolled in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/">Microsoft BizSpark Program</a> and it was great for getting off the ground, but projecting into the future we realized that everything - from our database down to our development environment would have to be paid for after 3 years. This might not be an issue for a large company, but when we sat down to assess what the bills would be - well let&#8217;s just say that it was about 5 figures. We put our business hats on and <strong>tried to justify that cost - and we couldn&#8217;t</strong>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Additionally the tooling around Ruby On Rails is just great:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><strong>RB:</strong> Why did you choose Ruby on Rails?</em></p>    <p><strong>RC: </strong>It&#8217;s what James and I both knew, and the plug-in story is very compelling. For instance - New Relic is a god-send. I don&#8217;t worry about the server freaking out, and I can see the &quot;choke points&quot; of all the code. They also track the highest-occurring queries and will even suggest improvements.</p>    <p>MongoMapper is an incredible data tool and MongoDB itself is faster than lightning. The Rails platform has matured to the point where it&#8217;s almost <strong>difficult to justify *not* using it</strong>. </p>    <p><strong>JA:</strong> All the problems we had (licensing, testing, deployments) could have been overcome. We could have used workarounds, written our own deployment framework, etc. What is comes down to is that we both really enjoy working with Rails and we enjoy the Rails community and the tools and libraries available. One of the best parts about running the show is that we get to do what <strong>makes us happy</strong>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>And the benefits seem to be huge. I am looking at that from the perspective of a TDD developer:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><strong>RB:</strong> What immediate benefits have you seen from the rewrite and the new design?</em></p>    <p><strong>RC: </strong>Immediate - the first thing people notice is the <strong>speed of it all</strong>. They also notice a bit of a &quot;tighter&quot; design which we were allowed to focus on a bit more as <strong>the server-side stuff is really trivial</strong>, to be honest.</p>    <p>Not only that - but we&#8217;ve had some <strong>issues that we were able to iron out within seconds</strong> as the deployment story is so very, very simple with Capistrano. Issue a fix and push - takes seconds.</p>    <p>Our testing suite grew tremendously as well - Cucumber is a joy to use and lets you do some things that are a bit hard with ASP.NET MVC. For instance - <strong>testing PayPal&#8217;s IPN posts are pretty tough with ASP</strong>. It&#8217;s possible to do - if you create a FormCollection and push it through - but couple that with the anti-forgery protection and the story gets a bit more difficult.</p>    <p>With Rails/Cucumber/Webrat, <strong>it&#8217;s a matter of filling out a hash and posting it…</strong>.</p>    <p><strong>JA:</strong> The most immediate benefit has been the <strong>speed at which we are making changes</strong> and <strong>pushing them up to production</strong>. On the ASP.NET MVC site I would often write SQL scripts to handle complicated support requests, like changing someone&#8217;s OpenID or combining accounts, but now I just spend the 30-60 minutes to write a couple of lines of Ruby and push it up.</p> </blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>And of course I could not miss quoting the comparison of Microsoft-based technologies with Ruby-based:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><strong>RB:</strong> How does your current testing methods compare to what you had on Microsoft?</em></p>    <p><strong>RC:</strong> 100% difference. It was a <strong>pain to test with the Microsoft</strong> stuff and when you&#8217;re poor and have 3 months until the money runs out, <strong>testing is something that you have a hard time justifying</strong>&#8230;&#160; [Then talking about ASP.NET MVC testing]… So I had some tests, but nothing to gives me the comfort I wanted. We did wrap the PayPal stuff in a ton of tests, you have to. When it comes to their API and I torched their sandbox environment for 3 straight days and STILL had issues rolling live.&#160; </p>    <p><strong>JA:</strong> <strong>Microsoft testing is always a fight, mainly because C# and static languages</strong> don&#8217;t lend themselves well to testing. It always feels like you are jumping through hoops when testing on .NET. That being said the SpecFlow framework on .NET does look very promising, but I doubt it can overcome all of the drawbacks of testing in .NET.</p> </blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>And this is probably really what it means to be Agile:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><strong>RB:</strong> What lessons or takeaways have you gotten from a total redesign?</em></p>    <p><strong>RC: </strong>None really - I think both James and I knew that we&#8217;d hit a point where we would need to adjust and rewrite…</p>    <p>We were lucky in that the idea took hold - we then moved into &quot;<strong>OK let&#8217;s plan for the next 3-5 years and go into controlled-growth mode</strong>&quot; - which is where we are now. We <strong>don&#8217;t want to be huge, we don&#8217;t want IT people or a group of developers who work on stuff</strong>. We want to <strong>do it ourselves and stay small</strong> - focusing on the idea that got us here.</p> </blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>And the lessons learned are just a ton of satisfaction:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><strong>RB:</strong> Do you see any weaknesses to the current architecture?&#160; What would you change if you were starting over again today?</em></p>    <p><strong>RC:</strong> Nothing on my end - I love it all. It&#8217;s weird for me - I&#8217;ve been a Microsoft person for a long time but putting on my business hat&#8230; well it just doesn&#8217;t make any sense at all for us. I like the idea that scaling comes at the cost of hardware&#160; - and it will be a really long time that we&#8217;ll need any. Our servers are essentially &quot;liquid&quot; and we can buff as needed. Can&#8217;t do that with the Microsoft boxes (from what I know) and if you try to latch on separate machines, you end up with a big bill. </p>    <p><strong>JA:</strong> The only change I would like to the current architecture is to break out MongoDB from our single server, it makes sense to run MongoDB in a pair whenever possible but with replica pairs being depreciated it makes sense for us to wait on the MongoDB team to develop their new pairing strategy and start with that. The cost of an addition two VMs and the fact that everything is running fine on our single server also deters us from doing this right now.</p></blockquote>  </div>

Have just watched the Developer Abuse video.<br />
Though it is probably meant to be funny, it made me very sad. Sad from the fact that there are a lot non-professional approaches to such a simple and well know IT area (and yes, it <i><b>IS</b></i> simple, it is not a rocket science). Sad due to the fact that I sometimes am in such situations and some of my friends are.<br />
And very sad because of very little number of universities actually promote the Agility and instead concentrate heavily just on the technology (which will become obsolete anyway very soonish). Thus newcomers often just have to educate themselves again to face the real-world (which changes continuously and all the time).<br />

The video is basically an advertisement of the company called ThoughtWorks. They heavily promote <a href="http://dnagir.blogspot.com/2010/02/agile-manifesto-reminder.html" rel="nofollow">Agile</a> style of work.<br />On the video there is a guy who wants to work that way but just cannot due to the environment he is being put in.</div>

Just a reminder about the agile <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">manifesto</a>. The purpose of this post is to read and write all that again and keep in mind <b>both left and right</b> parts of it. Just remember to<br />
<blockquote>
value in the items on the right, … value the items on the left more</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Individuals and interactions</b> over processes and tools</li>
<li><b>Working software</b> over comprehensive documentation</li>
<li><b>Customer collaboration</b> over contract negotiation</li>
<li><b>Responding to change</b> over following a plan</li>
</ul>
This all especially comes to mind after reading Ayende&#8217;s <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2010/02/20/nice-process-but-what-about-the-engineering-bits.aspx" target="_blank">post</a> about ignoring the actual building of the software.</div>

Have been watching the RubyConf 2009 <a href="http://rubyconf2009.confreaks.com/21-nov-2009-13-15-there-is-such-a-thing-as-too-much-testing-jake-scruggs.html" target="_blank">video</a>. And I liked the matrix which is based on 3 dimensions to determine level of testing. The questions you have to ask to determine how much testing you need should include:<br />
<ul>
<li>Did your tests stop/find bugs?      <br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>How often? </li>
<li>How soon? </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Was there good design?      <br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Did the tests encourage good design? </li>
<li>How easy was it to write new features? </li>
</ul>

<li>What&#8217;s the level of developer buy-in for testing? </li>
<li>What&#8217;s the level of buy-in for managers? </li>
<li>What level of assurance do you need? Are you really sure? (Lose a tweet – not a big deal, lose a life – thing you&#8217;re dead too). </li>
</ul>
The lessons are:<br />
<ul>
<li>Start small (do not do Selenium at least!). </li>
<li>Do not get new resources just to run your tests. They MUST be fast enough.      <br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Paralllelise. </li>
<li>Use fast machine or cloud. </li>
<li>Do not hit external resources (including DB if possible). </li>
<li>Profile and examine slow tests. </li>
<li>remove redundant tests. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Distinguish between model and integration test clearly. You often assert in model test instead of integration ones. </li>

I have found the <a href="http://viciproject.com/wiki/projects/mvc/home" target="_blank">ViciMVC</a> project and it caught my interest. What I can observe – it is really simple implementation of the MVC pattern for .NET (ASP.NET).<br />
The key points I should mention about it are:<br />
<ul>
<li>It is very lightweight.</li>
<li>It is very similar to Castle MonoRail and ASP.NET MVC.</li>
<li>It has its own, HTML based view engine which is based on their own <a href="http://viciproject.com/wiki/projects/parser/home" target="_blank">Vici parser</a>. The parser looks really great and allows to run C# code in it. Good work.</li>
<li>Unit testing is not bound to the HttpContext (as we all would expect) AND (this is huge for me) allow to render the resulting html so unit tests can just access raw output produced by the action.</li>
</ul>
The guys just did <b>what they want and how they want</b>. Great work overall.<br />
I just must mention the ViciProject. The tools are great. Simple, lightweight and looks like easy to use.</div>
