  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>A question has been raised whether or not <a href="http://ruby-challenge.rubylearning.org/">Ruby Challenge for Newbies</a> should exist or not. The main concern is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>…today, probably due to lack of time or other commitments, not many experienced Rubyists are willing to set a Ruby challenge for the newbies</p> </blockquote>  <p>I guess many Rubysts DO want to set the challenges, but unfortunately very few people these days have enough time.</p>  <p>Another problem with such challenges is that they are somewhat “detached” from the real life. Though I am not saying they are not interesting or educating. Don’t get me wrong, definitely they ARE. But still, I guess, many people would love to see how Ruby should be used correctly (the Rubyish way) in real-world applications. Especially in web apps.</p>  <p>So if there is the problem trying to find new challenges, then either WE need to set up new challenges and recommend people who can do that or, if that is not possible, the challenge itself might need to be &quot;converted&quot; to something different.</p>  <p>It seems the latter is the better choice at this moment.</p>  <p>Having said that, I believe that a good challenge should have attributes:</p>  <ul>   <li>driven by people; </li>    <li>not dependent on one person (though may be controlled by one or a group); </li>    <li>winner(s) appointed by the people (though influenced by the owner/controller); </li>    <li>collaborative; </li>    <li>“shareable”; </li>    <li>role-playing; </li> </ul>  <p>These are the ideas from the top of my head, but it is possible to play around those…</p>  <p>I personally feel like it brings us to the following idea of a challenge: <strong>Ruby Project Development challenge</strong>.</p>  <p>Somebody suggests an idea to implement (interesting web application, some kind of useful tool, etc). Then the challenge becomes a project that people have to deliver. There are main two roles in this challenge:</p>  <ol>   <li>product owners; </li>    <li>development team. </li> </ol>  <p>The <em>product owners</em> group consists of number of people who do like the idea but may not have time, ability to develop that. This group decides where the <em>development team</em> is heading to, and negotiates the requirements.</p>  <p>The <em>development team</em> is a group of self-organised people who do the actual development. Multiple development teams may exist to develop the same application.</p>  <p>The duration for the challenge may vary from weeks to couple of months. The winner of the challenge is the person who gets most number of votes from either product owners/development team or both (not sure yet). If there are multiple teams – then the winning team may also be chosen.</p>  <p>So the process of the challenge would be something like this:</p>  <ol>   <li>Somebody comes up with a project idea. </li>    <li>People join this project either as <em>product owner</em> or as <em>development team</em>. </li>    <li>People get organised in couple of development teams and a couple of product owners if too many guys have joined. </li>    <li>The countdown begins: <em>product owners</em> and <em>development teams</em> start working together (not necessarily at the same time). </li>    <li>During the work people should be able to see what others do, and help each other to deliver the product. </li>    <li>At the end of the challenge winners in following categories may be selected:      <ul>       <li>best developer; </li>        <li>best team; </li>        <li>best team-mate; </li>        <li>incredible inventor; </li>        <li>etc </li>     </ul>   </li> </ol>  <p>This of course is the basic idea, but it has sooo many variations.</p>  <p>So I propose the first challenge of this kind: <strong>Web applications supporting the challenge itself</strong>.</p>  </div>

Thanks for your comment, nice to know about all that.<br /><br />My idea was to start the challenge for a real application so that people can discuss what is happening.<br />The Ruby quiz and similar are pretty isolated (though a reaaallly interesting).<br />TopCoder is probably a good choice here, I was not aware of that at the moment I wrote the article.<br /><br />Thanks again for the suggestions.</div>

Check TopCoder if you haven&#39;t yet. They don&#39;t have Ruby competitions there, but they do have .Net and Java (and now Objective-C) and they pay real money for your time. So you can combine the pleasure of learning with receiving money for your work.<br /><br />As for the Ruby Challenge, there&#39;s enough groups like that around. Take Ruby Quiz for instance, that is out there what it seems for ages. They pose interesting challenges and discuss the solutions. Also, you can turn to Code Kata which is intended to develop the sense of the problem and practise your ability to think, while giving you a real-world problems to toy with.<br /><br />As I said, there&#39;s plenty, and there&#39;s totally no need to drive anything in existence to what you think the ideal. If you can&#39;t find what you need, imagine it as your next assignment &#8211; to create a web site like what you just described &#8211; and go implement it.<br /><br />Satish doesn&#39;t have time to work on the Ruby Challenge as he is riding a cool new wave of Clojure now, and you are concerned about his old favorite far more than he is. Take it easy. Projects come and go every day. :)</div>

I have watched the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWHkcCP3tA">RailsConf 2010 by Gary Vaynerchuk</a> and I believe that was <b>one of the best presentations I have seen</b> in a very long while.<br />
<br />
Gary is just outstanding and I highly recommend you to watch this video it (but be prepared - there is a log of swearing, which I actually like).<br />
<br />
There is nothing about Ruby (On Rails), .NET, Java or any other technology.<br />
This is just a talk about what you <b>should care about</b> as a business owner, this is about <b>appreciation of the digital era</b> we are living in. Also it is about <b>caring</b> about people, and <b>cutting bullshit</b>.<br />
<br />
Sit, make yourself comfortable and DO WATCH it:<br />

The new view engine is being released by Microsoft and looking at <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/02/introducing-razor.aspx" target="_blank">the announcement</a> I feel a bit confused. Two questions flying in my head:<br />
<ol>
<li>Why not take existing one and just help to make it better/sponsor?</li>
<li>Is it going to be a new productive thing or will it just make the view to be more spaghetti-like?</li>
</ol>
Not sure now. Time will show, but there are some things I feel I just must comment on. I&#8217;ll try to look at it as a developer with no any politics and trying to think how it can help me.<br />
<blockquote>
Unit Testable: The new view engine implementation will support the ability to unit test views (without requiring a controller or web-server, and can be hosted in any unit test project – no special app-domain required).</blockquote>
<br />
For me this one would probably be enough to jump onto that with head. I still have <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2781027/test-views-in-asp-net-mvc2-ala-rspec" target="_blank">the question</a> on StackOverflow about testing the view hanging around. It <i>looks like</i> now I have the answer.<br />
<blockquote>
the start of a code block with Razor using a @ character. Unlike &lt;% %&gt; code nuggets, Razor does not require  you to explicitly close the code-block</blockquote>
This is a huge typing and &#8220;mistake&#8221; saver. I like it, but still have the concern about the readability and ambiguity of such syntax. I need to give it a try first to tell whether this helps to do the job or screws things up. But the intention is definitely good.<br />
Next, the code blocks mixed together with HTML:<br />
<code>  &lt;ul&gt;<br />    @foreach(var p in products) {<br />      &lt;li&gt;@p.Name ($@p.Price)&lt;/li&gt;<br />    }<br />  &lt;/ul&gt;</code><br />
Currently it looks a bit weird to me. We need to get used to it.<br />
<br />
So you can do lots of interesting things using such syntax. Additionally I have to state that the engine has a special tag - <i>text</i>. It is used actually to avoid adding any wrapping tag to markup serving the purpose of grouping things together.<br />
<blockquote>
By default content emitted using a @ block is automatically HTML encoded to better protect against XSS attack scenarios.</blockquote>
That is something that I would expect from any view engine - encode by default. So far so good.<br />
<blockquote>
create re-usable HTML helpers using a more declarative approach.</blockquote>
I like this part <b>a lot (and I mean it)</b>, I won&#8217;t repeat what it is said in the post, but will explain how I can benefit from it.<br />
Currently I create a whole bunch of HTML helpers (written in .cs file in C#) which look very ugly should you have more than just a couple of them.<br />
It just becomes messy, hard to change, support and maintain. And the fact that C# generates HTML is very annoying for the same reasons. That should be the view&#8217;s concern.<br />
Now we have it - just create a file, mark its content as helper and it is available on all the pages. Beauty!<br />
(<b>NOTE</b>: actually after a bit more thinking we can do <i>similar</i> in Spark or NHaml. The word <i>similar</i> is used intentionally).<br />
<blockquote>
One other useful (and extremely powerful) feature we are enabling with Razor is the ability to pass “inline template” parameters to helper methods.  These &#8220;inline templates&#8221; can contain both HTML and code, and can be invoked on-demand by helper methods.</blockquote>
Previously we, generally, injected C# code into the template. Now we can do the other way around. Absolut power. Only God knows where it can bring us :) <br />
<h3>



What I want from it</h3>
One of the most frustrating things working with views in ASP.NET MVC is passing the values from a controller to a view. So the syntax that would read values from ViewData dictionary would the biggest time saver. Something along this:<br />
<code>
@currentTime.ToString("d")
</code>
<br />
which would be equivalent for <br />
<code>
((DateTime)ViewData["currentTime"]).ToString("d")
</code>

So that we do not even need to provide the time of the object in the ViewData.<br />
<br />
<h3>


Summary</h3>
The first impression is <b>very positive</b>. Though I have some doubts in the syntax acceptance.<br />
But I have no doubt that this engine is the way better than WebForms. Can&#8217;t yet say it is better than NHaml and Spark (and would not be fair to say that as they solve a bit different problems).<br />
This time I feel that <b>Microsoft has listened</b> to the developers and produced something that really brings value, productivity, less frustration and more fun (and fun is the starting point of being a happy developer who can bring value to a company).<br />

Looking at the screenshots I guess Visual Studio highlights the code separately, so it should be good enough.</div>

The big corporations are usually very conservative and in order to change something inside the huge bureaucracy people have to go through many obstacles and justify their decisions.<br />
I wonder how ones could justify that <a href="http://www.sutor.com/c/2010/07/ibm-moving-to-firefox-as-default-browser/" target="_blank">IBM is moving to the Firefox web browser</a>. Whatever the justification is I believe it the positive decision for the word-wide-web and normal people using the web.<br />
Do the corporations still have a passion and not only the financial benefits? Maybe both: complementing each other? That would be an idealistic world.</div>

If you are not living under the rock, you must know a lot of buzzing around HTML5 and CSS3.<br />
And if you want to keep up with technologies so that you won’t become a grand daddy saying “I work with HTML1 and no CSS which works on all browsers”, then you DO HAVE to learn HTML5.<br />
And there is one more opportunity for that, a great book from the great publisher (PragProg):<br />
<a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/bhh5/html5-and-css3" target="_blank">HTML5 and CSS3: Develop with Tomorrow&#8217;s Standards Today</a><br />

A while ago I wrote about <a href="http://blog.approache.com/2010/02/agile-manifesto-reminder.html">agile manifesto</a> everybody should keep in mind (when they claim to be agily-ish). Now I want to quote the principle of the Agile. This is another reminder for my after reading the great book - <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/news/the-agile-samurai">The Agile Samurai</a>. Highly recommend it.<br />
So here <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">they are</a>:<br />

<li>Our highest priority is to <b>satisfy the customer       </b>through <b>early and continuous delivery</b>      <br />of valuable software.</li>
<li><b>Welcome changing requirements</b>, even late in      <br />development. Agile processes harness change for      <br />the customer&#8217;s competitive advantage.</li>
<li><b>Deliver working software frequently</b>, from a      <br />couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a      <br />preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
<li>Business people and developers must <b>work       <br />together </b>daily throughout the project.</li>
<li>Build projects around <b>motivated individuals</b>.      <br />Give them the environment and support they need,      <br />and <b>trust them </b>to get the job done.</li>
<li>The most efficient and effective method of     <br />conveying information to and within a development      <br />team is <b>face-to-face conversation</b>.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>I am being reading the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/architecting-tekpub">Architecting TekPub - Moving from ASP.NET MVC to Ruby on Rail</a>. There are number of interesting things in there that I would like to quote.</p>  <p>First most notable is COST. ASP.NET MVC and thus Microsoft stack is pretty expensive and you cannot always justify the cost:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><strong>RB:</strong> If the platform [ASP.NET MVC] was holding up fine, what prompted the change of architecture?</em></p>    <p><strong>RC: </strong>Money. We were enrolled in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/">Microsoft BizSpark Program</a> and it was great for getting off the ground, but projecting into the future we realized that everything - from our database down to our development environment would have to be paid for after 3 years. This might not be an issue for a large company, but when we sat down to assess what the bills would be - well let&#8217;s just say that it was about 5 figures. We put our business hats on and <strong>tried to justify that cost - and we couldn&#8217;t</strong>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Additionally the tooling around Ruby On Rails is just great:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><strong>RB:</strong> Why did you choose Ruby on Rails?</em></p>    <p><strong>RC: </strong>It&#8217;s what James and I both knew, and the plug-in story is very compelling. For instance - New Relic is a god-send. I don&#8217;t worry about the server freaking out, and I can see the &quot;choke points&quot; of all the code. They also track the highest-occurring queries and will even suggest improvements.</p>    <p>MongoMapper is an incredible data tool and MongoDB itself is faster than lightning. The Rails platform has matured to the point where it&#8217;s almost <strong>difficult to justify *not* using it</strong>. </p>    <p><strong>JA:</strong> All the problems we had (licensing, testing, deployments) could have been overcome. We could have used workarounds, written our own deployment framework, etc. What is comes down to is that we both really enjoy working with Rails and we enjoy the Rails community and the tools and libraries available. One of the best parts about running the show is that we get to do what <strong>makes us happy</strong>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>And the benefits seem to be huge. I am looking at that from the perspective of a TDD developer:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><strong>RB:</strong> What immediate benefits have you seen from the rewrite and the new design?</em></p>    <p><strong>RC: </strong>Immediate - the first thing people notice is the <strong>speed of it all</strong>. They also notice a bit of a &quot;tighter&quot; design which we were allowed to focus on a bit more as <strong>the server-side stuff is really trivial</strong>, to be honest.</p>    <p>Not only that - but we&#8217;ve had some <strong>issues that we were able to iron out within seconds</strong> as the deployment story is so very, very simple with Capistrano. Issue a fix and push - takes seconds.</p>    <p>Our testing suite grew tremendously as well - Cucumber is a joy to use and lets you do some things that are a bit hard with ASP.NET MVC. For instance - <strong>testing PayPal&#8217;s IPN posts are pretty tough with ASP</strong>. It&#8217;s possible to do - if you create a FormCollection and push it through - but couple that with the anti-forgery protection and the story gets a bit more difficult.</p>    <p>With Rails/Cucumber/Webrat, <strong>it&#8217;s a matter of filling out a hash and posting it…</strong>.</p>    <p><strong>JA:</strong> The most immediate benefit has been the <strong>speed at which we are making changes</strong> and <strong>pushing them up to production</strong>. On the ASP.NET MVC site I would often write SQL scripts to handle complicated support requests, like changing someone&#8217;s OpenID or combining accounts, but now I just spend the 30-60 minutes to write a couple of lines of Ruby and push it up.</p> </blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>And of course I could not miss quoting the comparison of Microsoft-based technologies with Ruby-based:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><strong>RB:</strong> How does your current testing methods compare to what you had on Microsoft?</em></p>    <p><strong>RC:</strong> 100% difference. It was a <strong>pain to test with the Microsoft</strong> stuff and when you&#8217;re poor and have 3 months until the money runs out, <strong>testing is something that you have a hard time justifying</strong>&#8230;&#160; [Then talking about ASP.NET MVC testing]… So I had some tests, but nothing to gives me the comfort I wanted. We did wrap the PayPal stuff in a ton of tests, you have to. When it comes to their API and I torched their sandbox environment for 3 straight days and STILL had issues rolling live.&#160; </p>    <p><strong>JA:</strong> <strong>Microsoft testing is always a fight, mainly because C# and static languages</strong> don&#8217;t lend themselves well to testing. It always feels like you are jumping through hoops when testing on .NET. That being said the SpecFlow framework on .NET does look very promising, but I doubt it can overcome all of the drawbacks of testing in .NET.</p> </blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>And this is probably really what it means to be Agile:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><strong>RB:</strong> What lessons or takeaways have you gotten from a total redesign?</em></p>    <p><strong>RC: </strong>None really - I think both James and I knew that we&#8217;d hit a point where we would need to adjust and rewrite…</p>    <p>We were lucky in that the idea took hold - we then moved into &quot;<strong>OK let&#8217;s plan for the next 3-5 years and go into controlled-growth mode</strong>&quot; - which is where we are now. We <strong>don&#8217;t want to be huge, we don&#8217;t want IT people or a group of developers who work on stuff</strong>. We want to <strong>do it ourselves and stay small</strong> - focusing on the idea that got us here.</p> </blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>And the lessons learned are just a ton of satisfaction:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><strong>RB:</strong> Do you see any weaknesses to the current architecture?&#160; What would you change if you were starting over again today?</em></p>    <p><strong>RC:</strong> Nothing on my end - I love it all. It&#8217;s weird for me - I&#8217;ve been a Microsoft person for a long time but putting on my business hat&#8230; well it just doesn&#8217;t make any sense at all for us. I like the idea that scaling comes at the cost of hardware&#160; - and it will be a really long time that we&#8217;ll need any. Our servers are essentially &quot;liquid&quot; and we can buff as needed. Can&#8217;t do that with the Microsoft boxes (from what I know) and if you try to latch on separate machines, you end up with a big bill. </p>    <p><strong>JA:</strong> The only change I would like to the current architecture is to break out MongoDB from our single server, it makes sense to run MongoDB in a pair whenever possible but with replica pairs being depreciated it makes sense for us to wait on the MongoDB team to develop their new pairing strategy and start with that. The cost of an addition two VMs and the fact that everything is running fine on our single server also deters us from doing this right now.</p></blockquote>  </div>

A friend of mine just sent me the link:&nbsp;<a href="http://html5readiness.com/">HTML 5 Readiness</a>.<br />
Check it out - it shows browsers support for HTML5.<br />
<br />
As always Internet Explorer is far behind. Chrome is doing very, very well.<br />
<br />
And one more link (not really related) for myself as a note: <a href="http://everytimezone.com/">visual time zone representation</a>.</div>

One of the easiest and best <a href="http://apirocks.com/html5/html5.html">presentations about HTML5</a>.<br />
Just must see thing.<br />

What I like about it is that it:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>is actually a simple HTML5 web site;</li>
<li>describes most notable features of HTML5 AND</li>
<li>allow to see the features in action (provided that you browser supports HTML5).</li>

Have just watched the Developer Abuse video.<br />
Though it is probably meant to be funny, it made me very sad. Sad from the fact that there are a lot non-professional approaches to such a simple and well know IT area (and yes, it <i><b>IS</b></i> simple, it is not a rocket science). Sad due to the fact that I sometimes am in such situations and some of my friends are.<br />
And very sad because of very little number of universities actually promote the Agility and instead concentrate heavily just on the technology (which will become obsolete anyway very soonish). Thus newcomers often just have to educate themselves again to face the real-world (which changes continuously and all the time).<br />

The video is basically an advertisement of the company called ThoughtWorks. They heavily promote <a href="http://dnagir.blogspot.com/2010/02/agile-manifesto-reminder.html" rel="nofollow">Agile</a> style of work.<br />On the video there is a guy who wants to work that way but just cannot due to the environment he is being put in.</div>
