I see misuse of these 2 operators on every and each forum approximately at least couple of times a week. People don’t know/realise (or don’t want to) that there is significant difference in two code snippets below (I found similar on one of the forums):<br />
<pre class="csharpcode">var unknown = (<span class="kwrd">object</span>)<span class="kwrd">new</span> List&lt;<span class="kwrd">string</span>&gt;();

<span class="rem">// Snippet 1: as operator</span>
<span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (var item <span class="kwrd">in</span> unknown <span class="kwrd">as</span> IList&lt;<span class="kwrd">int</span>&gt;) {
 <span class="rem">// Do something with item</span>
}


<span class="rem">// Snippet 2: cast operator</span>
<span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (var item <span class="kwrd">in</span> (IList&lt;<span class="kwrd">int</span>&gt;)unknown) {
 <span class="rem">// Do something with item</span>
}</pre>
<style type="text/css">
.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
 font-size: small;
 color: black;
 font-family: consolas, &#8220;Courier New&#8221;, courier, monospace;
 background-color: #ffffff;
 /*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }

.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }
</style><br />
Both snippets will throw an exception. But, there is a big BUT.<br />
The first snippet will throw <b>NullReferenceException (Object reference not set to an instance of an object)</b>. Go and guess what’s going on. Especially in production when you probably don’t have call stack with code line information, especially in just a bit more complex scenario. <b>No useful information here at all.</b><br />
The second one will throw too, but it will be <b>InvalidCastException (Unable to cast object of type &#8216;System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.String]&#8217; to type &#8216;System.Collections.Generic.IList`1[System.Int32]&#8217;)</b>.<br />
See the difference? The later one tells you what exactly is wrong so you have a good starting point of fixing the issue.<br />
Generally I would tell to <b>never use AS operator</b> (even if you <i><b>think you know</b></i> the exact type NOW, you cannot be sure tomorrow) unless:<br />
<ol>
<li>You explicitly expect different type(s).</li>
<li>You want to determine type using IS operator (really bad practice, consider simple polymorphism instead).</li>
<li>You want to improve performance (though it is really, really rarely worth it).</li>
</ol>
<br />
Additionally, <b>in any case</b> you should <b>check the casting result for null</b>. Always check it for null. Do you hear me? <b>ALWAYS!</b></div>

Rick, you are absolutly right. There is no reason to use casting in the foreach as it will implicitly call GetEnumerator on the object which in turn can give NullReferenceException.<br /><br />The code I showed here is an example I saw on a forum, so just reused it. The issue you pointed out is a valid and major one. But I did not terget it in my post here&#8230; Well&#8230; I at least told to ALWAYS check for null :)&#8230; Should just add to check for null everything.</div>

Hmmm, I would say &quot;Never write it either of these ways if there is any chance it will throw an exception&quot;. If you are not in 100% control of what object is being used as the enumerable object, you should use var LoopObj = obj as TypeX and then check Abc for null before you use it in the loop. If you are in control of the object, then it still depends on if it is possible that the object might be possibly be null on it&#39;s own, in which case I will still do it as I advise.<br /><br />Rick W (from Eco forum)</div>

.NET 2.0 introduced a new method Validate on the page. It has additional parameter: validation group. As we all know and name suggests it indicates the group the validation should be applied to.<br />
But how do old Validate and new Validate(validationGroup) methods work together?<br />
Here is the flow when the the validation is executed via Validate(validationGroup) (it is the case with controls that have CausesValidation property):<br />
<ol>
<li>Validate(validationGroup) is executed.</li>
<li>It retrieves all the validators for the given group.</li>
<br />
<ol>
<li>Comparison is case-insensitive.</li>
<li>By default validationGroup is empty string for all validators and the controls that cause the validation.</li>
</ol>
<br />
<li>If the validationGroup is default one (eg: empty string) AND number of validators for the empty group is the same as total number of validators:</li>
<br />
<ol>
<li>YES: Fallback to the .NET 1.1 Validation without validation group.</li>
<li>NO: Execute each validator retrieved in step 2.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
The flow if you call validation using the old way: Validate without parameters. It just executes the step 1.1 described above.<br />
So the moral is, if you override the Validate without parameters to perform custom logic it won’t necessarily be called every time. So the moral of the story is:<br />
<ol>
<li>Use only one validation method. And it must be Validate with validationGroup as it is called automatically by the controls and at the step 3.2 ignores the default (Validate without parameters) method.</li>
<li>Override only one validation method to avoid double validation logic (which should be the same as in point 1).</li>
<li>Make sure you manually call only one validation method. Again according to 1.</li>
</ol>
So we really should keep this in mind as forgetting to call Validate() instead of Validate(string.Empty) will break the validation, and very likely to be found in production as WebForms testing is painful.<br />
I think this approach is wrong. It’s aim was to maintain backwards compatibility (which works up to some point). But it had one of the following ways:<br />
<ol>
<li>I would better prefer to have broken interface and removed/obsolete old Validate (without parameter) method.</li>
<li>To avoid breaking functionality the default Validate had to call Validate(string.Empty) and not other way around.</li>
</ol>
So after migrating to ASP.NET 2.0 still fighting WebForms… and its “compatibility” which “hidden incompatibility”.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Last weekend I’ve got the <a href="http://www.prototypegame.com/" target="_blank">Prototype Game</a>. I like it a lot and the game play is very enjoying. But all that came did not come such simple. After I installed the game and tried it on me Athlon XP 64 6000+ and GeForce 6500 512 MB system I had probably about 5 FPS in the game. The system still satisfies minimum requirements.<br />
I though that my systems is already old for the game, so I upgrades CPU and graphic card to x4 Phenom 9650 and Radeon 4850 1GB graphic card. I expected at least <i>some</i> improvement in the game experience, to play the game at least a bit smoother… But the hardware upgrade did not change anything (at least visually I could not mention the difference).<br />
And this is at 640x480 resolution with everything set to minimum (though there are no many options in the game itself).<br />
I went to their forum and found that many people have performance issues with this game. And the suggestion to fix it is to <b>disable all HID devices (USB devices) except ones in use (mouse/keyboard)</b>.<br />
It is weird but it worked for me. Now I can play the game pretty smoothly at its max.<br />
I probably did not need to upgrade at all. But I like the new system :). I hardly ever need the QUAD processor at home except for gaming. The rating on my Vista is 5.9 which is neither best ever score nor worst. I have 5.9 on each item in the system. On the prev system lowest score was 5.4: HDD; 5.6 - Memory. After upgrading CPU and graphic card I got 5.9 on every item. So far so good. Waiting for the next hungry game.<br />
And one more time, I really enjoy the game… Even knowing that I don’t like so much killing and stuff like that.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Thinking about parameterised <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nhaml/issues/detail?id=56" target="_blank">partial views in NHAML</a>.<br />
<h4>
User perspective (view)</h4>
How I want to use the partials:<br />
_ TextBox(“FirstName”, “Given Name”)    <br />_ TextBox(“FirstName”)     <br />_ TextBox<br />
<br />
<h4>
User perspective (partial)</h4>
Define the _TextBox partial:<br />
! (string key, string title=”Provide value:”)    <br />&nbsp; = Html.LabelFor(key).Title(title + variableFromView)     <br />&nbsp; = Html.TextBox(key)<br />
the <b>first line defines set of parameters</b> for the partials. They can be used <b>as regular variables </b>on the partial view and do not intersect in any way with variables on the view. These are <b>local variables only</b>. So we can have integer key variable on the view with value 12345 and string key variable on the partial view with value “partial”. Of course the “partial” value should be the value used in the partial view. Additionally if there are no parameters passed <b>defaults are used</b>.<br />
<br />
<h4>
Requirements</h4>
<ol>
<li>View overrides variables used in outer scope. </li>
<li>View can access outer-scope variables [POTENTIALLY SHOULD AVOID]. </li>
<li>Parameter values have default value if not specified in the actual list of parameters. </li>
<li>Parameter can define a default value which will be used if no value has been provided. </li>
</ol>
<h4>
Implementation thoughts</h4>
To satisfy requirements #1, it seems the partial view should be isolated from the rest of the view processing to be able to handle local variables (In C# it is impossible to have variable with the same name in one method). This behaviour is totally different from the way NHAML works now. Currently any view, partial, partial of partial (of partial…) are executed in one, single scope; generally, sharing all the variables.<br />
To satisfy the requirement #2 we must execute all the partial code in the same scope as the partial view itself. But this won’t satisfy requirement #1.<br />
So at the moment, C# does not allow to implement this at the moment. And as a workaround for this we could discard requirement #2.<br />
The requirements 3 and 4 should not be hard to do.<br />
Possible implementation in meta-code for the <b>NHAML generated code</b> could look like:<br />
<pre class="csharpcode"><span class="rem">// NHAML: _ TextBox("FirstName"), isolating the scope</span>
<span class="kwrd">new</span> NhamlGeneratedPartialTextBox(<span class="kwrd">this</span>).Render(<span class="str">"FirstName"</span>, <span class="str">"Provide value:"</span>);
<span class="rem">// NHAML: _ TextBox</span>
<span class="kwrd">new</span> NhamlGeneratedPartialTextBox(<span class="kwrd">this</span>).Render(<span class="kwrd">default</span>(<span class="kwrd">string</span>), <span class="str">"Provide value:"</span>);</pre>
<style type="text/css">
.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
 font-size: small;
 color: black;
 font-family: consolas, &#8220;Courier New&#8221;, courier, monospace;
 background-color: #ffffff;
 /*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
 background-color: #f4f4f4;
 width: 100%;
 margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }
</style>

<br />
So I would say we can pay the price of not being able to access global variables from partial for the sake of partial parameters.<br />
Also I should mention that the way NHAML works now (joining all the partials into one scope) does not feel good/safe for me. I hit couple of issues with it previously that make my partials strongly bound to the view where they are used. So the <b>partials should be isolated</b>.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Please do not laugh at me now after reading the next sentence. I am <i><b>evaluating</b></i> the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/" target="_blank">ReSharper</a> now.&nbsp; I should do it years ago as I have always been aware of it, but just didn’t get my hands on to it. I tried <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/Coding_Assistance/" target="_blank">CodeRush and Refactor!</a> from DevExpress too. I must admin these tools do not read your mind, but are doing a great job FOR you.<br />
What I liked in DevExpress CodeRush+Refactor! is its fun visualisations and code complexity shown. Refactorings are great as well.<br />
But, ReSharper aims to help you with coding more than just showing some information about it (though it does it too).<br />
Additionally, CodeRush has great support for expandable shortcuts, lets calls it consistently – Live Templates. There are thousands of them in CodeRush. But honestly saying I dont use it as much. Visual Studio templates in 99.99% of cases do the job for me. I have to mention that ReSharper does support its own live templates and tries to make it smart (at least by providing sensible defaults).<br />
While I haven’t had intention to compare Refactor! vs ReSharper, I would say “<i>DevExpress’ product adds fun to coding, while ReSharper adds quality to coding</i>”. Many can disagree and have the right for that.<br />
So here is the small list the ReSharper benefits me with:<br />
<ol>
<li>Run your unit-test from IDE (Not only MsTest but other common ones too). </li>
<li>Clean-up the code in the whole file using different strategies. The code looks much better after that. </li>
<li>Automatically include file header (I have to put copyright notice, so it saves my time). </li>
<li>It easily removes redundant using statements. </li>
<li>It automatically adds using statements for extension methods or anything that is not yet available. This one I just love. Here is the scenario:      <br />
<ol>
<li>You have an IEnumerable&lt;Something&gt; list; in a new file. </li>
<li>You type list.Where(); </li>
<li>ReSharper suggests: “Use method System.Linq.IEnumerable&lt;Something&gt;.Where”. </li>
<li>You hit enter and it’s done. </li>
<li>It suggest to rename file to match the class name. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>It warns (I changed it to ‘suggest’) to move class to the namespace according to the location on the file system. </li>
<li>It automatically highlights possible NullReferenceExceptions. </li>
<li>It validates the names of classes, methods, properties etc thus enforcing the consistency and guidelines. Not only it validates, but with one hit of Enter it renames it accordingly. </li>
<li>It warns about unused parameters. It saves my time so I don’t have to debug for hours to spot the parameter is never used and the actual value is hardcoded instead. </li>
<li>It selects current file in the solution explorer (don’t know why VS still doesn’t do it). </li>
<li>Live templates are very smart. </li>
<li>Easily reorder members using Ctrl-Alt-Shift and arrows. </li>
<li>It shows NotImplementedExceptions in case you forgot something and have no test for it </li>
<li>Shows great list of notes, todos, bug-notes etc extracted from your code and organised in a single window. </li>
<li>And lots of other things I forgot to mention… </li>
</ol>
I also started to use a new word together with <i><b>refactoring</b></i>… and it is… <i><b>resharping</b></i>.<br />
Additionally I have to mention that while evaluating ReSharper I migrated large project from .NET 1.1 and Borland Developer Studio 2006 to .NET 3.5 and Visual Studio 2008 (including all of its related assemblies). ReSharper definitely saved me at least 20-40% of time during this not the most pleasant process.<br />
The biggest disadvantages I can see using ReSharper for now is that it slows down the IDE, increases memory consumption, especially on a large solution. But I can pay price easily for all the benefits.</div>

Ok. I got a <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/Q230483.aspx" rel="nofollow">reply from the DevExpress</a> about the licensing. Posting here to remove all the possible speculations.</div>

DAS,<br /><br />You do not install a new product. You possibly install a new version of the product. But I doubt even that because I don&#39;t believe DevExpress releases a new version each month.<br /><br />Anyway, You are right this went off-topic. <br /><br />It would be interesting to see Refactor! Pro features you find the most useful on a daily basis.</div>

I don&#39;t see the point  to continue the discussion about the licensing, because it&#39;s out of this topic. <br /><br />I read the license agreement and I didn&#39;t find that I break it, because I cannot download  the same SOFTWARE PRODUCT(S), I always uninstall it, before installing a NEw one, which has new features and bugs which I have to evaluate&#8230;<br />I will defently buy it if they change the EULA.</div>

I don&#39;t really understant what the disadvantage of ReSharper is in terms of licensing.<br /><br />You can evaluate Refactor! for, technically, unlimited time, but it violates the law and you still have to buy it (see below). The price is higher then ReSharper&#39;s one.<br /><br />On the other hand I can evaluate ReSharper for 30 days. And I recently asked to evaluate it for another month with no problem.<br /><br />So generally you can evaluate ReSharper for the period enough for you to decide.<br /><br />It is basicly same as Refactor! but still for the lower price.<br /><br />Once again, the Refactor! can be used for free ONLY for the <b>evaluation</b> purposes (as the <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Support/EULAs/RefactorPro.xml" rel="nofollow">license clearly states that</a>).<br /><br />Also please pay attention that Refactor! Pro evaluation license is also valid for only 30 days:<br /><i><br />If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT(S) you have obtained is marked as a &quot;TRIAL&quot; or &quot;EVALUATION,&quot; you may install one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT(S) for testing purposes for a period of 30 calendar days from the date of installation (&quot;Evaluation Period&quot;). Upon expiration of the Evaluation Period, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT(S) must be uninstalled and all copies destroyed.<br /></i></div>

DAS,<br />Cannot agree more about Refactoring tools and code snippets.<br />But sometimes the codesnippets just get overused and that was the Alexander&#39;s point.<br /><br />As for the CodeRush, you DO have to buy it. It is NOT a free product. It is only free to evaluate. If you evaluate the product for couple of years (when in fact you just use the product) I believe you break their licensing and thus law.<br />Also you must buy Refactor! Pro AND CodeRush.<br /><br />If you come to the pricing - ReSharper is cheaper and provides much more useful functionality (for me at least).</div>

It&#39;s very useful to use templates.<br /><br />I use them a lot. They simplify my life.<br />e.g Instead of typing &#39;MessageBox.Show(&quot;&quot;);&quot;<br />I can type just &#39;mb + space&#39;<br /><br />Also it saves time to create property, methods and so on&#8230;<br />You simply can wrap your code into try catch block just pressing one key,<br /><br />e.g. I often wrap my code by using template into <br /><br />try<br />{<br />   // code<br />}<br />catch(SomeException ex)<br />{<br />   ExceptionManger.Publish(ex);<br />}<br /><br />with refactoring tool I can spent more time to think how to better implement it, and not spend valuable time of typing :)<br /><br />People don&#39;t use 90% of functionality of sophisticated tools because they don&#39;t know how to use it :) and don&#39;t to spent time to learn.<br /><br />I still use CodeRush. Recently they added lots of new functionality like ReSharper has (cleaning code, highlighting unused variables, etc.)<br /><br />But ReSharper has a very big disadvantage - I have to buy it, CodeRush I have not</div>

my 5 cents. <br /><br />I think that using templates is not a good thing. Sipmly saying, if template complexty goes beyond comment heading and class A{} structure, it starts to become code duplication. <br /><br />As for refactoring functionality - yeah, I liked reShaper as well, though have not been using for quite a long time (&#39;cause in Java now)<br /><br /><br />I&#39;ve also found out that the 90% of the time 90% of the functionality of rich developer&#39;s IDE tools are not used. Most of the time I try thinking on HOW do I implement this or that. <br /><br />After you know how - you do it. <br /><br />Surely, it does not cut off some mechanical work, like migration from one .net version to another. No one likes doing dumb work. <br /><br />Though, tools make life easier until you rely on them completely :) <br /><br />I still remember DAS trying to code smth on our lectures within a studio without (CodeRush?). <br /><br />Keyboard script follows: (keys as they are hit)<br />fpi (backspace)(backspace) public void int method(){&#8230;</div>

Yeah, i agree. Resharper its a good thins. But as you mentioned - it realy slows the IDE. In some cases - work in IDE becames impossible. It&#39;s really main disadvantage of Resharper.</div>

This post is inspired by the <a href="http://blog.codeville.net/2009/08/31/simplify-iteration-in-your-mvc-views/">one</a> from Steve Sanderson. He wants to improve the table generation on the WebForms engine in ASP.NET MVC. I definitely recommend to switch to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nhaml/">NHAML</a> instead.<br />
<br />
This is how it would look: (there is no tbody - must be Steve&#8217;s mistake, anyway I&#8217;ll leave it as is)<br />
<pre><code>

%table
  %thead
    %th Rank
    %th Name
    %th Age
  %tbody
    - var people.Model.ToList();
    - for(int index=0; index&lt;people.Count; index++) {
      - var cssClass = "myitem-" + (index % 2 == 0 ? "odd" : "even");
      - if (index == people.Count-1) cssClass += " myitem-last";
        %tr {class=cssClass}
          %td
            = index + 1
            .
          %td
            &amp;= people[index].Name
          %td
            &amp;= people[index].Age



</code></pre>
And this is much more readable for me, especially comparing to the <a href="http://blog.codeville.net/2009/08/31/simplify-iteration-in-your-mvc-views/">original</a>.<br />
Also keep in mind there are no any extension methods used, just pure C# and NHAML.<br />
Adding some extension methods I would probably make it look like this:
<br />
<pre><code>

%table
  %thead
    %th Rank
    %th Name
    %th Age
  %tbody
    - for(int index=0; index&lt;Model.People.Count; index++) {
        %tr{ class=#{Model.People.RowClassFor(index)} }
          %td
            = index + 1
            .
          %td
            &amp;= people[index].Name
          %td
            &amp;= people[index].Age

</code></pre>
<br />
<br />
And we have only simplest possible extension method: RowClassFor. It can be reused in all the tables so you don&#8217;t need to modify million of view in order to change css classes.<br />
Looks much better? Don&#8217;t you agree?</div>

The NHAML community is not very large but it is under continuous development and improvement. There are couple nice fellas working on it. Check the SVN history and you will see.<br /><br />Additionally there are large number of tests for NHAML. So I can sleep well using it.<br /><br />Also you can easily contribute to it and are very welcome to do so. Just ask at the user groups and I believe you will get invited.</div>

Hi - I accidentally discovered NHaml and like what I have seen so far. However, the community seems very quiet and not a lot seems to be happening. Am I missing something or is NHaml winding down. <br /><br />I would appreciate any information available.</div>

I have mentioned that empty strings never have null values during data binding. Instead they are empty strings. If we don’t do anything with it, it will propagate to the database. I don’t really want to have empty strings in there. Nulls should be in the database instead. The easiest solution is to re-implement the default data-binder. And here it is:<br />
<pre class="csharpcode"><span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> NullStringModelBinder : DefaultModelBinder {
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">object</span> BindModel(ControllerContext controllerContext, ModelBindingContext bindingContext) {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (bindingContext.ModelType == <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">string</span>)) {
            ValueProviderResult result;
            bindingContext.ValueProvider.TryGetValue(bindingContext.ModelName, <span class="kwrd">out</span> result);
            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (result != <span class="kwrd">null</span>) {
                <span class="kwrd">try</span> {
                    var str = (<span class="kwrd">string</span>)result.ConvertTo(<span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">string</span>));
                    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (<span class="kwrd">string</span>.IsNullOrEmpty(str))
                        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">null</span>; <span class="rem">// These two lines are the only ones I need</span>
                    <span class="kwrd">return</span> str;
                } <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (Exception ex) {
                    bindingContext.ModelState.AddModelError(bindingContext.ModelName, ex);
                    <span class="rem">// Don't forget to set value to Workaround ASP.NET MVC bug</span>
                    bindingContext.ModelState.SetModelValue(bindingContext.ModelName, <span class="kwrd">new</span> ValueProviderResult(<span class="kwrd">null</span>, <span class="kwrd">null</span>, CultureInfo.CurrentCulture));
                }
            }
        }
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">base</span>.BindModel(controllerContext, bindingContext);
    }

I don’t know if this is a good solution and for me it really seems the empty values should be bound as NULLs for strings. The reasoning is simple: <b><i>if user does not provide value it is null</i></b>. With this solution user <b>cannot provide an empty string</b>, but I can live with it for now.<br />
One options would be NOT to post empty values. But it would not set NULLs to the actual objects if there some other value assigned. Additionally it is not out-of-the box functionality in ASP.NET MVC.<br />
Thou, would be interesting to know a <i>perfect</i> solution for this.</div>

I don&#39;t want to store any value if user did not provide such. Thus it should be NULL.<br /><br />Additionally ASP.NET MVC 2 will bind the empty string values as NULLs by default. And this is what i expected in ASP.NET MVC 1 as well. Unfortunately it is not the case and I have to fix it manually.</div>

Sometimes you should store an empty value instead of null.<br /><br />Some controls in my application have EmptyIsNull property wich I use to tell databinding how to store empty values.</div>

Just sharing my experience migrating large project (~170 classes in Business Objects ONLY) from Eco3 (Borland C# Builder and Together Modeler) to <a href="http://capableobjects.com/" target="_blank">Eco5</a>. <br />
This outlines the problems I faced, I don&#8217;t want to dig into details and try to reproduce each case as I have had enough pain already. I also don’t care if it is <i>by-design</i>. I would describe the process not <i>the migration</i> but <i>the copy-pasting</i>.<br />
<ol>
<li>Code is not migrated. THE MOST of time is wasted doing copy-paste (in best case). </li>
<li>Interfaces are not migrated (so I have to put all the interfaces back and because of 1 implement them). </li>
<li>One-to-many association names are not preserved and default names are used. Breaks code. And no it is not even cross-package references. The association links 2 classes from same package on the same diagram. </li>
<li>Some associations are not imported at all. </li>
<li>The import process <i><b>added attributes</b></i> to classes that do not belong there. It definitely breaks runtime as mapping will not contain them (and yes, I discovered it later). </li>
<li>The import does not preserve IsNavigable for some associations. </li>
<li>Wrong migration of attributes in large hierarchy: the attribute in the middle of hierarchy has been put into its parent. </li>
<li>Import the same package twice gives very weird result: it duplicates all TaggedValues, Constraints, and <b>method parameters </b>(not methods)! Better it said me that the package already imported and did nothing as I had to manually correct everything. </li>
<li>The EcoSpace had to be reconfigured from scratch as there are too many changes from Borland.* to Eco.*. </li>
<li>Ordered value for associations is not preserved in some case (discover very late when could not make couple of tests pass). </li>
</ol>
I spent more than one and a half day for all that and now I can compile my model <b>AND</b> tests project. I still have some things marked with ObsoleteAttribute, but I’ll get to it later as I will be doing refactorings.<br />
The issues I have faced making all my tests to pass (related to ECO only):<br />
<ol>
<li>I cannot longer use custom class as type of an attribute (custom Money class). <b>This is a real showstopper</b>. Why newer version supports LESS! I had to use Decimal instead of custom class.&nbsp; <br /><span style="font-family: Courier New;">Attribute ClassName.TotalCostsAmount has an invalid type: Shared.Money. Only arrays, enums, strings and valuetypes are allowed</span> </li>
<li><strike>Significant </strike>OCL syntax changes that <b>breaks the runtime</b>. It cannot be detected at compile time as OCL is just a string. <strike>Best example:&nbsp; “<span style="font-family: Courier New;">self.Name-&gt;trim(true, true).length &gt; 0</span>”. which trims the string on both sides (indicated by boolean parameters). Now it should use normal .NET Trim method: “<span style="font-family: Courier New;">self.Name.Trim().length &gt; 0</span>”.</strike>&nbsp; (I missed to install my trim OCL operation).</li>
<li>HasUserCode on associations is not available. That was simple way of doing things (thou you have to prohibit explicitly other ways of changing associations). Now I have to implement <a href="http://www.capableobjects.com/apps/InstantForum414/FindPost3798.aspx" target="_blank">ISingleLinkCatcher</a>. Much better in terms of functionality but much worse in terms of maintenance. </li>
<li>The <a href="http://magpie.no-ip.com/mantis/view.php?id=524" target="_blank">bug</a> is still not fixed (derived attribute that uses externalId is not invalidate if it changes).</li>
<li>The <a href="http://magpie.no-ip.com/mantis/view.php?id=523" target="_blank">logging</a> has not been improved.</li>
</ol>
Usability issues on with the UML designer<br />
<ol>
<li>Cannot specify additional namespaces to be used for the whole package (so I have to go through every class). </li>
<li>Code generation takes a lot of time for simple change (2 minutes). It is related to the migration as during this process I often have to regenerate code and it just kills my time. </li>
<li>Cannot select MANY objects (properties, methods, associations) and change values for all of them. Instead have to go one by one (Don’t tell me I have to use the AutoForm!). </li>
<li>Sometimes the Modelr just freezes. It SHOWS the model but it is READ-ONLY. I cannot even select anything on it. VS restart helps. </li>
<li>Cannot search class <b>on the diagram</b> (“select as you type” kind of thing). There is search for the whole model but not on a single diagram.</li>
</ol>
<br />
<h4>
The outcome</h4>
<ul>
<li>About 12 hours to migrate the model and compile project. </li>
<li>About 4 (16 in total) hours to make ~40% of tests to pass. </li>
<li>About 4 (20 in total) hours to make ~90% of tests to pass. </li>
<li>About 2 (22 in total) hours to make all tests to pass EXCEPT ONE. </li>
<li>About 2 (24 in total) hours to make the last test to pass (related to the fact that I no longer use the Database for unit testing). </li>
</ul>
<h4>
Breathing out</h4>
At the moment of writing this I have my new ECO5 business objects and all the tests working.<br />
The migration process has not yet finished for the application in total but the major step is done and I can tell that I am happy with the overall result despite some frustrations.<br />
The biggest frustration is that I had to copy-paste old code to new objects. It probably took at least 80% of my time.<br />
Next thing is to migrate small WinForms utility. Will see how I go with it.<br />
<h4>
Last Note for those who does not want to write unit tests</h4>
It took me 3 working days to migrate all my system core with tests. Additionally tests were just a healthiness indicator. I am confident that without unit tests it would take at least one-two weeks in best case scenario.<br />
So guys: “&#8221;Stressed? Write a test!”.</div>

You probably already know that <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2009/07/30/asp.net-mvc-released.aspx" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC Preview 1 has been released</a>. You can quickly watch the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Glucose/Hanselminutes-on-9-ASPNET-MVC-2-Preview-1-with-Phil-Haack-and-Virtual-Scott/" target="_blank">video</a> to get the impression.<br />
Overall, I must admit, I like it. Things I like the most:<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee308450%28VS.100%29.aspx" target="_blank">Display and Edit Templates</a> – I did workaround it in MVC 1 by using partials with specific name,</li>
<li>Areas support. As <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/07/31/asp-net-mvc-v2-preview-1-released.aspx" target="_blank">Scott explains</a> it allows to reuse various ASP.NET MVC projects.</li>
</ul>
What is do DISLIKE here:<br />
<ul>
<li><b>DataAnnotation</b> validation support – why are we <b>forced to apply attributes</b> on our model. I often have situations where I cannot tell exact validation rule developing the Model. I should specify it later. No way of doing it with DataAnnotations. There MUST be an interface for custom validation provider.</li>
<li>As far as I understand (from the Release Notes) <b>Views from Area projects should be copied</b> over to the main project. This IS UGLY IT IS NOT REUSABLE VIEW, IT IS CUT-AND-PASTABLE VIEW with all the consequences.</li>
</ul>
And I am also not sure what the effort is involved for ViewEngines to support the new Templates. I <i><b>guess</b></i>, it should not be a big deal. But it needs some attention.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Another useful tip for NHAML users that I came up with. I am assuming the site with following technical description:<br />
<ol>
<li>Every page has common CSS. </li>
<li>Every page has common scripts. </li>
<li>Some page may include up to 2 additional CSS files. </li>
<li>Some pages may include up to 2 additional JS files. </li>
<li>Soma pages may include Google Maps Script. </li>
<li>Some pages may include some of the above based on conditions. </li>
</ol>
Having these I want to make it as easy as it can be. With WebForms view engine it is not really problematic but it is too verbose. It means more code, more time spent more errors.<br />
But with NHAML it makes it a breath.<br />
Satisfying requirements 1 and 2 i not a problem at all. This is not a problem with WebForms as well. Just including those files in the master page.<br />
What about other? Well, easy. Here is whet i write to satisfy 3 and 4.<br />
<pre class="csharpcode">^ css = ""
^ script = ""
%h2 Product Details

OR
^ css = "another"
^ script = "another"
%h2 Product Details</pre>
<style type="text/css">
.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
 font-size: small;
 color: black;
 font-family: consolas, &#8220;Courier New&#8221;, courier, monospace;
 background-color: #ffffff;
 /*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
 background-color: #f4f4f4;
 width: 100%;
 margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }
</style>

<br />
<br />
What happens here? By using empty string I declare that I want to include the script/css from the default location with default name for the given controller. This is convenient and conventional. This way I enforce that the assets (JS, CSS) are not going to be mixed with views or something else.<br />
In first example I just say “Hey! I need CSS and Script for current controller!”. 
  <br />In second example I say&nbsp; “Hey! I need CSS and Script for current controller with name <i>another</i>!”. 

  <br />
You don’t care how and where they will be included. You just tell what you need. That’s it.<br />
This is how we can include 2 script and 2 CSSs:<br />
<pre class="csharpcode">^ css = <span class="str">""</span>
^ script = <span class="str">""</span>
^ csss = <span class="str">"another"</span>
^ scripts = <span class="str">"another"</span></pre>
<br />
Ok. Let’s go to 5. The idea is the same but much more “typed”:<br />
<pre class="csharpcode">^ needMap = <span class="kwrd">true</span>
^ script = <span class="str">"map-integration"</span></pre>
Can it be any easier? We say here: “Mate, I need map on this page. Also don’t forget to give me script that integrates the map with my page.”.<br />
<br />
Ok. Now we came to the last point – 6. This is freaking easy as well:<br />
<pre class="csharpcode">- if (Model.CanEdit)
  ^ script = ""
  ^ css = ""
  ^ needMap = true
  ^ script2 = "map-integration"</pre>
We tell here: “If current user can edit this page then please add default script and css for the controller, include map and integration script for it.”<br />
And the possibilities to play with it are unlimited. How does this magic happen?<br />
All is defined in the NHAML “master page” which is called <i>layout</i>. And here it is:<br />
<pre class="csharpcode">^ string css = null;

I don’t want to explain this – go figure. This is easy as well… Or… ok. in 2 words:<br />
<ol>
<li>We define .NET variable in the layout using “^” symbol. </li>
<li>The variables defined using “^” are accessible in any page. </li>
<li>There are 2 types of code blocks in NHAML: 
    <br />
<ol>
<li>starts with “-” - evaluates in its own scope (for simplicity let’s say its scope of page of another block); </li>
<li>starts with “^” – evaluates in the global scope AND before all other scoped blocks (eg: “-”). </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/SimonCropp" target="_blank">Simon</a> for explaining this.<br />
Exercise for you: make the layout to satisfy these requirements:<br />
<ol>
<li>Some pages may have page title (the one shown in the browser): “Action – Area – SiteName” </li>
<li>Some pages may have page title: “Action – SiteName” or “Area – SiteName”. </li>
<li>If neither Action nor Area are provided site will have in its title “SiteName”. </li>
<li>A page should not be required to specify anything if it doesn’t need to. So if a page doesn’t provide neither Action nor Area it should not have any code at all to handle this. </li>
</ol>
Can you do that? [Tip: NHAML supports extension methods as well.]</div>
