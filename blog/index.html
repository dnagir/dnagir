  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;ve been a Blogger user for a while and decided to switch over to something more geeky.</p>

<p>This post will cover some of the reasons for that and also will provide an overview
of how to actually migrate it.</p>

<h2>What do I want to achieve?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Merging</strong> my personal site and blog - those were totally separate, unrelated entities. Wanted to merge the two.</li>
<li>Write <strong>more often</strong>, using the same tools I use on a daily basis (Vim ATM).</li>
<li>More <strong>hands on</strong> blog itself, I actually do want to do the dirty work massing with HTML/CSS etc.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Reasons for switching:</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mardown, HAML, bare bones HTML</strong>. I wanted to have a bit more control over how my blog looks like.</li>
<li><strong>Blogging software</strong> isn&#8217;t good enough. Unfortunately I haven&#8217;t found yet a good <strong>geeky</strong> S/W for blogging.</li>
<li><strong>Easier to write</strong> from VIM. I just fire up my editor.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Why I didn&#8217;t want to switch:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Losing <strong>PageRank</strong>, which shuldn&#8217;t really be an issue (see below).</li>
<li><strong>Uncerteinities</strong>. So now I have to maintain it myself? Take care of updates? Ohh, yeah!</li>
<li><strong>Self-hosted</strong>. Nothing to say here, never worry about hosting.</li>
</ul>


<p>I have been on blogger since 2006 and have never ever needed to do anything to the blog in terms of mainteinance.</p>

<p>Switching to a self-hosted blog/site will require a bit of involvement in this regard.
But this is something I am willing to take. It&#8217;s time to take my ass out of the comfy couch of Blogger.</p>

<h2>So how to actually migrate?</h2>

<p>I would split it into 2 larger steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Preparation.</li>
<li>Deployment.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>At this stage you need to setup the Octopress itself, configure it and import your existing posts from Blogger.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t go into details how to customise and set it up. You know where to get that information from.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll go directly into the migrating the Blogger posts over to Octopress.
This part is relatively simple.</p>

<p>What you need to do is</p>

<ol>
<li>Export your Blogger posts.</li>
<li>Grab <a href="https://gist.github.com/1765496">this script</a> and put it under <code>source</code> directory.</li>
<li>Run the script as below.</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>&gt; <span class="nb">cd</span> ./source
</span><span class='line'>&gt; ruby import.rb ~/Downloads/path-to-blogger-file.xml
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After you do this, all you&#8217;ll get a bunch of the posts that are already part of your site.
Double check whether everything is correct or not. You may want to tweak the script for your needs.</p>

<p>Note that the script also imports the comments, but in a little ugly way.
Also you may want to disable comments before exporting the Blogger to avoid missing any comments.</p>

<p>Next thing you want to do is to update your Octopress RSS feed URL so that existing subscribers won&#8217;t be lost.
I am using FeedBurner and I had to set <code>subscribe_rss: http://feeds.feedburner.com/DmitriyNagirnyak</code> in the <code>_config.yml</code></p>

<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got your posts, you want to set-up the redirection from your blog to your new site.</p>

<p>I prepared <a href="https://github.com/dnagir/approache-redirects/blob/master/app.rb">simple Sinatra application</a> for that.
You definitely want to fork and tweek it to your needs. Note that I&#8217;m not using the <code>blog/YYYY/MM/DD/title</code> format.
I just use the <code>blog/title</code> format.</p>

<p>Now go ahead and deploy this app. I&#8217;ve decided to use Heroku for that which is the simplest and easiest way to go.
But make sure you deploy to the domain of your blog. For example, mine was <code>blog.approache.com</code> and I deployed it to this domain.</p>

<p>It of course will not take any affect until you change your DNS settings. But you are safe to go now when you do.</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

<p>By now you should have:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Octopress site ready to go (with all the posts migrated).</li>
<li>Blogger redirection deployed.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now go ahead and actually <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying">deploy</a> your Octopress site.
I wanted to merge <code>blog.approache.com</code> into the <code>aproache.com</code> so I deployed the new site to <code>approache.com</code>
that&#8217;s hosted by <em>Github Pages</em>.</p>

<p>Now make sure everything is working properly and you have dome everything right.
If you&#8217;ve missed something out, then go ahead and fix it. Then redeploy.</p>

<p>Repeat and rinse until happy.</p>

<p>When you are happy with what you have on the Octopress, the very last thing to do is to <strong>disable the Blogger</strong>.</p>

<p>You should do it simply by changing your DNS record to point to your Octopress server (often it&#8217;s an <code>A-record</code>).
In my case I hade to change the DNS record from <code>CNAME - ghs.google.com</code> to <code>A - 207.97.227.245</code></p>

<p>Since you&#8217;ve already deployed your redirection app to that domain, all the user will be automatically redirected to your new Octopress site.
All the PageRank should be preserved since the redirection is permanent.</p>

<p>That should be it.
Hope this is helpful for you.</p>

If you wonder how you can use KnockoutJS with Rails in a similar way to Backbone.js or Spine.js then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJzQl-bpmUI">watch the video</a>. It also shows how easy it is to apply client side validations that work alongsite with the server-side validations.<br />
<br />

Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/dnagir/knockout-rails">knockout-rails</a> project for more details.

This is actually <a href="https://gist.github.com/9ca5dce0524927d69655" rel="nofollow">one of the options</a> of validating in the background: <br /><br />It doesn&#39;t include the bindings, but gives idea how it can be done. Easier than I thought actually.</div>

Pre-validating on the server can technically be done with the Model Events. But it&#39;s not supported out of the box.<br /><br />It is a good idea, but there&#39;s a bit more complexity involved on both client and server. But I&#39;ll gladly accept pull requests to knockout-rails if somebody needs to support that.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<b>UDPATE</b>: The reason for switching to JRuby the native neo4j API. Have to use REST API with MRI.<br />
<br />
This is just a quick recap of what issues I have had trying to switch existing app from MRI Ruby (1.9.3) to JRuby (1.6.4).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I stepped back and didn&#8217;t want to spend more time as it felt an unbreakable chain of issues. Resolving one, you think &#8220;huh, awesome&#8221;. But very soon you hit the next.<br />
And I couldn&#8217;t see it stopping.<br />
<br />
<b>But PLEASE bear in mind</b> that I only spent a couple of hours on that. With a little bit more persistence, you may be able to the end of the tunnel.<br />
<br />
The overall impression is that it is not a big deal really. The problems arise when trying to use other libraries. And unfortunately, not all of the gems <b>care deep enough to support JRuby</b>. And this is the biggest issue in my opinion, there are very little issues with JRuby itself. The transition (from the syntax perspective) was extremely easy.<br />
<br />
The application is pretty standard Rails 3.1 app that uses gems like Dragonfly, inherited_resources, cancan, paper_trail, Authlogic, CoffeeScript, Haml, Sass, Formtastic etc. For testing - things like rspec-rails, cucumber-rails, capybara-webkit, guard (rspec and cucumber), database_cleaner etc.<br />
<br />
So here is a quick list of the things that I faced on my way.<br />
<br />
Before everything else I enabled support for 1.9 syntax in JRuby (export JRUBY_OPTS=&#8211;1.9).<br />
<br />
It all first started with <a href="https://gist.github.com/1402753">the weird issue</a> where the <b>wrong arguments were passed to RSpec shared example</b>.<br />
Unfortunately I did not figure out why it happened and just patched it as you can see in the comments there.<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1402753.js?file=sample_spec.rb">
</script>

<br />
<br />
<br />
After fixing this issue I had another one related to <b>database_cleaner</b>. So I ended up with a <a href="https://github.com/bmabey/database_cleaner/pull/83">pull request</a> that worked for me.<br />
<br />
The other issue was a<b> huge stack trace</b>. I scrolled 3 pages in the terminal to get to the top. Most of that stack trace is deep inside Java. Additionally I got <b>wrong line number</b> on exception. This &#8220;features/step_definitions/company_steps.rb:234&#8221; makes me thing that the exception is at line 234. But that file only had 49 lines of code. Now, go figure.<br />
<br />
Going on&#8230; <a href="https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov">SimpleCov</a> gem didn&#8217;t work out of the box and gave the warning that I need to enable debugging. That&#8217;s fine and understandable. But after half an hour of debugging of unrelated exception, it turned out that <b>SimpleCove threw an exception</b> because of that. So had to go and explicitly disable it.<br />
<br />
Then I managed to run all of my specs. But I was pretty surprised how <b>slow</b> it was:<br />
<pre><code>
# rvm use 1.9.3
# time rspec # real=14s, rspec time ~ 12s

# rvm use jruby
# time rspec # real=52s, rspec time ~ 30s

</code>
</pre>
But this is expected as JRuby doesn&#8217;t have enough time to optimise here. It should be much better in production. But it will be also shit slow after deployment.<br />
Ok. That&#8217;s fine. <b>I can trust it&#8217;s fast</b>.<br />
<br />
Then I tried running the cucumber specs and had to file the <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-6237">issue</a> to support <b>new Ruby 1.9.3 syntax</b> (a = b = f 1). Not a big deal, easily fixed with parens: a = b = f(1).<br />
<br />
Next and the <b>final issue</b> - I could not run the <b>headless cucumber specs</b> (capybara-webkit). It just got stuck (no CPU used) and feels like there is a <b>dead-lock</b> or something similar.<br />
<br />
I couldn&#8217;t see way of fixing it easily and decided that for now I am <b>done with</b> it. So going <b>back to Ruby 1.9.3</b>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>To summarise</b>, I <b>did not feel like it&#8217;s a problem</b> to switch to JRuby. But it&#8217;s really a <b>big deal to actually use</b> it due to the number of <b>C extensions</b> that JRuby doesn&#8217;t really support.<br />
<br />
Again, to emphasise, there is nothing horribly wrong with JRuby and it seems to be pretty good. But the real showstoppers are the C extensions.</div></div>

Totally with you on this. But real world seems to be a bit different :)</div>
</div>
<div class='comment'>
<div class='author'>Postmodern</div>
<div class='content'>
Yet another reason to avoid C-extensions. When selecting dependencies for a new project, I prefer to select pure-Ruby libraries or FFI bindings (https://github.com/ffi/ffi#readme). Pure-Ruby libraries should be faster on Rubinius/JRuby. FFI bindings work perfectly on both MRI and JRuby.<br /><br />If developers want faster Ruby code, they should help make MRI faster (or switch to Rubinius/JRuby), instead of writing more code in C.</div>

Some of the most valuable things you can learn are not written in books, not shown in the presentations and demos. Those come from seeing how <i>others</i> work.<br />
<br />
How do they do all those small things? What tricks do they have? How would they approach that problem?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t remember seeing people sharing the way they actually work (unless they pair). I want to see what mistakes they make, how they fix those, how they try to come up with a word erasing a line 10 times.<br />
I believe all this is of a great value for a lot of us.<br />
<br />
What I described is <i>partially</i>&nbsp;done by PeepCode&#8217;s Play By Play series and Tekpub. Those are amazing (usually). But that&#8217;s not exactly what I am after. Those screencasts are high quality, polished and prepared ones. YOU are NOT featuring there. I want to see YOU there. All of you, guys.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I decided to make a first step (or maybe not so) and screencast myself while working on a Rails Plugin.<br />
<br />
This is mostly real-time work. You&#8217;ll see how I fail, you&#8217;ll spot the mistakes I&#8217;ve done and did not even notice, you&#8217;ll see how I write README. And, most importantly, you will hopefully see some of the things that will help <i>yourself</i>.<br />
<br />
This video features the following tools/technologies:<br />
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Ruby, Ruby On Rails</li>
<li>CoffeeScript</li>
<li>SASS</li>
<li>Git, Github</li>
<li>Vim (MacVim and Terminal)</li>
<li>Jasmine and basic testing of JavaScript and even CSS assets</li>

Great video. I also love the music. Beethoven seems to get extra-dramatic near the testing pain point :)<br /><br />Look forward to seeing more in the future and hope to do some  myself.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Flaviu</div>

If more people will need it, I will probably upload higher resolution somewhere. Have you tried <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWvLofLz04k" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a>?<br /><br />And in the future I will have to record at much lower screen resolution</div>

If see screencast from page - text is unreadable and font size is too small, at full screen (1080p) - too blur and unreadable too. may be if i&#39;ll have possibility to view at custom player size - it&#39;s will be ok.</div>

Keep your config in a separate dotfiles directory and under source control with the structure like:<br />

<pre><code>
~/dotfiles:
--+ bashrc, bash_profile
--+ ssh/config
-->--bash -&gt; (env, config, aliases). bash has source bach/env, bash/config etc.
</code></pre>

<br />
Then:<br />
<code>ln -s ~/.bashrc ~/bin/dotfiles</code>
<br />
<code>echo ". ~/.bashrc" > ~/.bash_profile</code>

<br />
<br />

Put everything into .bashrc except any long running tasks.<br />
.bash_profile - for interactive shells. But you can just usually source .bashrc.<br />

Now some keyboard shortcuts:<br />
<br />

<ul>
<li>Cntrl-a - go to the beginning of line</li>
<li>Cntrl-e - go to the end of line</li>
<li>Cntrl-k - delete everything to the right</li>
<li>Cntrl-w - delete previous word</li>
<li>ESC->-b - go back one word</li>
<li>ESC->-f - go forward one word</li>
</ul>

<br />
If you often connect via SSH like so:
<code>ssh -p 2323 username@my-server.example.com</code>

Then you can shorten it to <code>ssh my-server</code> if you will add entry to <code>~/.ssh/config</code>:
<pre><code>
Host my-server
    HostName my-server.example.com
    Port 2323
    User username
</code></pre>

Then you can use it as:

<pre><code>
# Tunnelling
ssh -L7997:127.0.0.1:7979 my-server

# Copy folder to server
scp my_folder my-server:my_other_folder/

# Or even use it with git
git clone my-server:repo-name.git

</code></pre>

<br /><br />

Now some useful things you can do in the terminal:

<ul>
<li><code>!!</code> - run previously executed command (you can do `sudo !!` for example)</li>
<li><code>!$</code> - last argument of previous command</li>
<li><code>!60</code> - run the command #60. Number comes from <code>history</code> command</li>
(for example: run <code>tail file.log</code> and then <code>cat !$</code> is same as <code>cat file.log</code></li>
<li><code>!echo</code> - rerun last command starting with echo</li>
<li>Ctrl-r - interactive search on history of commands; Use Ctrl-j to abandon.</li>
<li><code>!?file.log?!</code> - run the last matching command (not interactive)</li>
<li><code>^file.log^another-file.log</code> - run the last matching command replacing file.log with another-file.log</li>
<li><code>!?file.log?!</code> - run the last matching command (not interactive)</li>
<li><code>mv README.{txt,markdown}</code> - same as <code>mv README.txt README.markdown</code>.</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

You will also appreciate power of the shell when using aliases and functions:
<pre><code>
alias ss=&quot;./script/server&quot;
alias s=&quot;git status&quot;
alias gca=&quot;git commit -am&quot;
alias zipr=&quot;zip -r&quot;

function take {
  mkdir $1
  cd $1
}
# take create-and-go-here

function gg() {
  git commit -v -a -m &quot;$*&quot;
}
# gg Commit message with no quotes
</code></pre>

<br /> <br />
But when functions get more complicated, you might want to use a scripting language (Ruby, Python etc).

<br />
Put those scripts into your ~/bin directory and add it to your PATH variable.

<br /><br />
There are also number of Mac specific tricks.
<br />
One is is <code>open anything</code> command that will open the file/directory in the default application.
<br />
You can also force it to use a specific app:
<code>open -a /Applications/Firefox.app index.html</code>.
<br />
This one becomes a good candiate for an alias.

<br /> <br />
You can also pipe output of any command into <code>pbcopy</code> command to copy it to the clipboard.
<br />
For example:
<code>cat index.html | pbcopy</code> will copy the content of the file into clipboard.
<br /><br />
You can also do it the other way around: <code>pbpaste &gt; index.html</code> or 
<code>pbpaste | grep "jquery"</code>.
<br /><br /><br />

Another useful thing <a href='http://homepage.mac.com/thomasw/OpenTerminal/'>OpenTerminal</a> (drag the app to finder toolbar).
It allows you to open terminal with the current directory set to the Finder window.

<br /><br /><br />
You can also use the keyboard to open terminal using <a href='http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/'>LaunchBar</a>. It does much more though. It acts like a global terminal for the system.


<br /><br /><br />
You can also try to use <code>zsh</code> shell. It will work with the existing bash aliases just fine.
<br /><br /><br />

Most of the tips here come from the PeepCode&#8217;s Advanced Command Line screencast.
<br />

Hope this helps you on your way to becoming a Terminal Guru.

<h3>
HAML templating with no worries: native, precompiled HAML. Blazing fast and as easy to use as it can be. </h3>

<h3>
<strong>
<em>UPDATE: this functionality moved into <a href='https://github.com/dnagir/ruby-haml-js'>ruby-haml-js</a> gem, please use it instead.</em>
</strong>
</h3>

Recently I have been working on a Ruby gem that packs a set of common JavaScript libraries in one place so you can just reference those easily from <b>Rails 3.1</b> app.  But now I want to write a bit about a very handy tool that the gem includes.  I needed to work on a <a href='http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone'>Backbone</a> app and, unfortunately, there was no very simple and easy way of using HAML markup for my client side templates. Main problems: <ol>
<li>I don&#8217;t want to <b>embed</b> the template into the document.</li>
<li>The Underscore.js templating is ok, but it is <b>too verbose</b> for me (as most of others).</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/creationix/haml-js">haml-js</a> is great, but I do not want to bother <b>precompiling</b> the templates.</li>
<li>I do not want to think about templating as another layer or component. I want it to <b>just work</b>.</li>
</ol>

<div>
Fortunately it was pretty easy solve these <em>problems</em> with the <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets">Sprockets</a> and Rails 3.1.
</div>

<div>
So from now on you can just write normal HAML templates and consume those with no worries from JavaScript.
</div>

<div>
All you need to do, is to add <a href="https://github.com/dnagir/pakunok">pakunok</a> gem to your Rails 3.1 Gemfile.  This will give you templates as <b>native JavaScript functions</b> that you can use.

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2011-05-19T00:58:00+10:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 19<span>th</span>, 2011</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>
In my <a href="http://blog.approache.com/2011/05/setting-up-ubuntu-1104-server-for-rails.html">previous post</a> I provided some info about setting up the server for rails app.

</p>

<p>
Now I am going to describe the Nginx configuration and example of Capistrano deployment file.
</p>

<p>
One thing that I don&#8217;t want to do for every new app I deploy is to go to the web server and change the settings (as a root user) so that the web server picks the Rails application.
</p>

<p>
In order to avoid that I decided to use nginx&#8217;s <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/CoreModule#include">include</a> command. It allows to add include multiple nginx config files using UNIX wildcards.
</p>

<p>
So by simply adding this line to the nginx.config I make it possible to configure Nginx from Rails applicatoins themselves:
<code>include /home/*/apps/*/current/nginx.conf;</code>.

I decided to include all configs within <code>http</code> tag so that a Rails app can configure multiple servers for itself.
</p>

<p>
There are obvious drawbacks for this:

<ol>
<li>It is less &#8220;safe&#8221; as on application might affect others if you will start adding Nginx settings outside of the <code>server</code> tag. But I am ready to sacrifice this for the sake of having more flexibility by assuming all server citizens are good guys.</li>
<li>We still need to have root access to restart the Nginx. We shouldn&#8217;t need to do it often, so that&#8217;s ok with me.</li>
</ol>

Now relying on a very simple conventions, I can configure Nginx from within the app. Just in case you&#8217;ve missed it, the conventions are:

<ol>
<li>To deploy a rails app (and any Rack based app), user should put the app under his home directory in <code>apps/[name]/current</code>.</li>
<li>To &#8220;enable&#8221; an app, user should put <code>nginx.conf</code> file in <code>apps/[name]/current</code>.</li></ol>

</p>


<p>
But for now, all this cool structure isn&#8217;t very helpful unless we deploy the app.
</p>

<p>
I went with the Ruby de-facto deployment tool - Capistrano. There are enough resources on the net on how to &#8220;Capify&#8221; your application, so I won&#8217;t go into details. I assume you have just done <code>capify .</code> and understand what is going in there.
</p>

<p>
Briefly, what I need to do is following:

<ol>
<li>Deploy the app explicitly to a particular domain (staging, production, local server etc).</li>
<li>On every deployment - backup SQLite database (I know, I&#8217;ll use something better when I&#8217;ll have 1 million users).</li>
<li>Prepare Nginx config file for the server (it depends on the domain we deploy at).</li>
<li>Pre-Compile assets (SCSS in my case).</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>
So grab <a href="https://gist.github.com/978737">the gist</a> (embedded below) with all the details and let me know what can be improved there. The usage is pretty simple: 
</p>

<p>
<code>cap deploy user=dnagir domain=connecty.approache.com</code>
</br />
You can deploy the same app multiple times to the same server with different subdomains and they will not conflict:
<br />

<code>cap deploy user=dnagir domain=staging.connecty.approache.com</code>
<br />
<code>cap deploy user=dnagir domain=demo.connecty.approache.com</code>

</p>

<p>
The most interesting I think is that the <code>nginx.conf</code> file is created during deployment using default Ruby templating engine and transfered over to the right location on the server. (But still remember root-ed Nginx restart is still required).
</p>

<p>You can look at the complete source in the <a href="https://github.com/dnagir/connecty/tree/bdd10b8e2bcd946a62cc66075d87ac107e513305">Connecty project</a> at Github.
</p>

<p>Please feel free to tell me what you think about this process.</p>

I had to set up the server (Ubuntu 11.04) for running couple of Rails apps and thought I could share the notes I&#8217;ve written while doing that. 

Any feedback and improvements are welcome.

That should be enough for you to start using the server.
In the <a href="http://blog.approache.com/2011/05/easy-rails-deployment-with-capistrano.html">future post I plan to describe my setup to make deploying new applications easier</a>.

I&#39;ve used this guide for 3 apps and it&#39;s worked great.  However the step &quot;use one place for installation&quot; wipes everything out for some reason so I skip that part but otherwise thanks.</div>

One of the most interesting videos I watched from the <a href="http://video2010.scottishrubyconference.com/">Scottish RubyConf 2010</a> is <a href="http://video2010.scottishrubyconference.com/show_video/6/1">Unix: Rediscovering the wheel</a>. If you use Ruby/Rails and POSIX systems you gotta know those things.
This is just a quick list of notes to keep it mind. So you will have to Google if something catches your attention.
</p>

<p>

<code>
<pre>

Scheduling tasks with Cron
==========================
- define all tasks in cron
- don't make Ruby do scheduling


Background processing with ATD daemon
======================================
echo "convert image.jpg image.png" | batch


Logging with syslog
======================================
- don't use rails log

Resource limiting with rlimit
======================================
ulimit -v 102400
ruby -e "' ' * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 *1"
failed to allocate memory (NoMemoryError)

CPU and Disk IO priorities
======================================
nice -n 19 rake xapian:update # run rake with priority 19
ionice -c3 rake xapian:update # same for disk IO


Atomic renames
======================================
- don't use locks
- write to temp then rename

Secure self-cleaning temporary files
======================================
- create temp fie
- delete it while holding it open
- write/read securely


Page cache expiry with find
======================================
find public/cache -type f --mmin +10 -delete # del all files 10 mins old in a "transaction"

Log rotation with logrotate
======================================
- Rails sucks at it, use time proven and tested UNIX


Managing daemons with start-stop-daemon
==========================================
- don't reinvent the wheel starting/stoping daemons (mogrels etc)
    start-stop-daemon -d $railsdir -b -o -p $pidfile --start --starts rake xapian:update
- run cron tasks using start-stop-daemon to avoid race condition (it will exit if process already runs)


Real time signals
==========================================
use it in ruby:
trap("USR1") { reopen_xapian_db }


Raliable messaging with... SMTP!
==========================================
Due to atomic and reliable delivery it can be use as a message queue.
Can replace RabbitHQ etc


dbus
==========================================
UNIX based Messaging system


Self-organising systems with AVAHI
==========================================
Bonjour??


Modularised config files
==========================================
/etc/cron.d/rails-myapp
/etc/logrotate.d/rails-myapp


Watchdog daemon
==========================================
